Although the correlation between GC and <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection has been extensively confirmed [<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GC remain to be fully defined.</p><p>Chronic inflammation and persistent bacterial infection lead to the progression of gastritis to IM and GC. This process is supported by the activation of a number of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways by <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori,</italic> which are important for the recruitment of immune cells to the gastric mucosa. Among those, interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing T cells are considered responsible for much of the pathology inflicted by <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. IFN-γ produced by infiltrating lymphocytes activates STAT1 through the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y) 701. The IFN-γ receptor employs JAK1 and JAK2 to phosphorylate exclusively STAT1, causing its homodimerization. Phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1) homodimers can translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to DNA, promote transcription of target genes, and induce the expression of proteins that affect basic cell activities and immune responses [<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths [<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. GC evolves over decades from superficial gastritis to adenocarcinoma, and the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection induces immune cell infiltration in the human stomach, and the consecutive dysregulation of cytokine receptor signaling is a key event not only regulating the immune response to the infection but also orchestrating changes related to chronic inflammation, development of GC and progression, and immune escape of gastric tumors. In the current study, we showed that STAT1 is activated as an early response to <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection. STAT1 is generally considered to function as a tumor suppressor, but there is growing evidence showing that STAT1 can also act as a tumor promotor [<xref rid="B23-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several studies suggested this tumor-promoting function to be related to STAT1-mediated regulation of PD-L1 expression [<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In agreement, our results support a tumor-promoting effect of STAT1 expression and activation since it is upregulated at early stages of <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-induced inflammation and increases along the progression of gastric lesions to GC. More importantly, STAT1 expression is associated with poor survival, supporting a detrimental effect of STAT1 signaling during gastric tumorigenesis. One possible mechanism leading to this effect could be the upregulation of target genes, such as PD-L1. Indeed, we observed STAT1 activation to be accompanied by the upregulation of PD-L1 in gastric epithelial cells suggesting that PD-L1 might be a target gene of STAT1 upon <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection. Importantly, PD-L1 also correlated with poor prognosis, and both STAT1 and PD-L1 expression were also highly correlated with immune cell infiltration. <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-induced immune cell infiltration is well recognized as an important driver of inflammation-associated gastric tumorigenesis, while tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have been studied for their roles as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in GC. In particular, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are the main effector cells directly killing transformed cells [<xref rid="B28-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], were demonstrated to be associated with better survival of patients with GC [<xref rid="B29-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results are in line with these previous studies and further correlate STAT1 and PD-L1 expression with CD8+ T cell infiltration. In light of our results, we hypothesize that upregulation of PD-L1 expression via STAT1 activation in gastric epithelial transformed cells suppresses anti-tumor immune responses of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. This facilitates tumor immune escape and consequently enables tumor progression and growth.</p><p>Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, provides a new opportunity for GC treatment. Our findings showing that STAT1 is independently associated with poor prognosis suggest the analysis of JAK-STAT1 signaling in GC patients to better assess prognosis. Moreover, the use of inhibitors or antagonists of this pathway should be considered to enhance the success of PD1/PD-L1 blockade therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-23-04147"><title>4.

Proteins were detected by applying an ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-ijms-23-04147"><title>4.4. Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Human gastric biopsy samples from paraffin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks were obtained from the tissue bank of the Institute of Pathology, Klinikum Bayreuth in Germany, after the approval of the local ethics committee (155_20B). FFPE gastric samples from mice [<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] previously described were used in the present study. Briefly, Rnf43 mutant mice were generated by introducing two point mutations in the RING domain of Rnf43 through homology-directed repair. Six- to eight-week-old mice were infected twice with 2 × 10<sup>8</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> strain PMSS1 diluted in 200 μL brain-heart infusion (BHI) containing 20% FCS by oral gavage and sacrificed after 6 months. Stomachs were dissected, and tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and paraffin embedded. Human and mice gastric tissue samples from wild-type (WT) and Rnf43 mutant mice were incubated with specific antibodies (<xref rid="ijms-23-04147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) overnight after antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker using 10 mM sodium citrate (pH6) or 1 mM EDTA (pH8) (p-STAT1 in humans and mice, and PD-L1 in humans). After incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, sections were developed using SignalStain DAB substrate (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), and counterstained with hematoxylin (Morphisto, Frankfurt, Germany). The slides were scanned and analyzed using an Olympus Virtual Slide Imaging System (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Five random high-power field areas per sample were quantified in a blind manner. Positive staining cells were counted dividing by area and mean values of five random areas for each slide were used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-ijms-23-04147"><title>4.5. Statistical Analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.0) software. Differential gene or protein expression analysis was tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and with two-sides, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The correlation of gene or protein expression was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation coefficients. The immune infiltration level of TCGA gastric tumors was estimated by a deconvolution method previously published [<xref rid="B21-ijms-23-04147" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Probabilities of overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier (KM) method and compared using the log-rank test or the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The Youden index was used as the cut-off point to stratify patients with different prognoses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-ijms-23-04147"><title>5.

In meta-organisms, dietary components are digested and metabolized by the host and its gut microbiota. Fructose has been shown to induce proliferation and cell growth in pancreas and colon cancer cell lines and also alter the gut microbiota. In a previous study with the L2-IL-1B mouse model, we showed that a high-fat diet (HFD) accelerated EAC progression from its precursor lesion Barrett’s esophagus (BE) through changes in the gut microbiota. Aiming to investigate whether a high-fructose diet (HFrD) also alters the gut microbiota and favors EAC carcinogenesis, we assessed the effects of HFrD on the phenotype and intestinal microbial communities of L2-IL1B mice. Results showed a moderate acceleration in histologic disease progression, a mild effect on the systemic inflammatory response, metabolic changes in the host, and a shift in the composition, metabolism, and functionality of intestinal microbial communities. We conclude that HFrD alters the overall balance of the gut microbiota and induces an acceleration in EAC progression in a less pronounced manner than HFD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Barrett’s esophagus</kwd><kwd>esophageal adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>IL-1B-mouse model</kwd><kwd>Western diet</kwd><kwd>fructose</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The increase in many industrialized countries of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and associated comorbidities suggests that food choices have an impact on the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, particularly cancer [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The intake of energy-dense, processed foods rich in refined sugars, salt, and saturated fat is common in industrialized nations, where obesity-associated cancer types occur more frequently. It has been suggested that these food components lead to modifications of the gut microbiome, metabolic changes in the host, and chronic inflammation, which favors carcinogenesis [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of many cancer types associated with obesity. Over the past decades, the incidence of EAC in most Western industrialized countries has increased at a rate exceeding that of any other cancer, with a 5-year survival rate that remains poor [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The risk factors for EAC include white race, older age, male gender, tobacco use, high waist circumference, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but the greatest risk factor is Barrett’s esophagus (BE) [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. BE is an acquired premalignant condition of the distal esophagus characterized by the replacement of normal squamous epithelium by columnar epithelium above the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), with varying degrees of intestinal metaplasia [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. BE appears to be the result of severe esophageal mucosa injury, followed by aberrant epithelial repair [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Dietary modifications can lead to microbial alterations in the gut, with effects on stem cell biology and susceptibility to gastrointestinal neoplasia. Considering that environmental or dietary factors prevalent in obese patients influence the risk of BE progression, we recently investigated the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the progression of BE in the L2-IL1B mouse model [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The L2-IL1B mouse model overexpresses IL-1B in the esophagus and phenocopies human BE [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We showed that HFD-fed L2-IL1B mice developed esophageal dysplasia and tumors more rapidly than mice fed a control diet (CD) and linked this neoplastic acceleration to shifts in the gut microbiota with an increased esophageal infiltration of immune cells [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the mice did not develop obesity but maintained a constant weight, possibly due to increased metabolism related to the systemic inflammatory state, we concluded that the alterations to the microbiome and not the high body weight per se led to neoplastic acceleration. In addition to high fat intake, a westernized diet comprises a high intake of refined sugars, which can lead to increased inflammation [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and progression of chronic diseases. Processed foods and beverages contain concentrated amounts of refined sugars and, thus, high concentrations of fructose. When consumed in fruits and vegetables, the intake of fructose is accompanied by vitamins, micronutrients, and fiber, whereas the intake of refined fructose has been linked with the metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous in vitro experiments have shown the potential of fructose to induce proliferation and cell growth [<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in pancreatic cancer cell lines [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], immortalized pancreatic ductual cells [<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and human colon adenocarcinoma cells [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A high-fructose diet (HFrD) was shown to alter gut microbiota and enhance the inflammatory changes in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model [<xref rid="B14-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the potential effect of HFrD on other gastrointestinal diseases such as esophageal adenocarcinoma remained unclear. In regard to the increased consumption of refined fructose, a better understanding of the link between high-fructose intake and disease is of great importance. In general, a part of the ingested food escapes digestion in the small intestine, reaches the colon, and is fermented by gut microbes. Thus, composition and functionality of gastrointestinal microbiota is influenced by the dietary habits of the host, since different microbial strains favor certain environment and nutrients [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Based on previous results [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and considering that fructose alters the intestinal microbiota [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the aim of the present work was to investigate whether a HFrD accelerates esophageal carcinogenesis in a manner similarly to HFD, as both dietary components favor obesity and potentially cancer if consumed excessively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>2.

Animals</title><p>For this study, mice of the BE-mouse model L2-IL1B [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], overexpressing human IL1B under control of the EBV-L2 promoter were kept under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions and fed with control diet or high-fructose diet (CD, HFrD; Ssniff, Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) from 2 to 6 or 9 months of age in randomized cohorts. The 6-month cohort was composed of 21 mice, 11 mice were HFrD fed and 10 mice were CD fed. The 9-month cohort was composed of 20 mice, 10 mice were HFrD fed and 10 mice were CD fed. The animal experimental work of this study was conducted under the approval of the district government of Upper Bavaria, according to the animal experimental permit 55.2-1-54-2532-24-2016.

Tissue Preparation and Disease Evaluation </title><p>Macroscopic scoring of the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and the esophagus was performed on images of the opened and cleaned stomach of all mice. Histopathologic scoring and estimation of the percentage of goblet-like (GC) cells at the SCJ on HE stained formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were performed by an experienced gastroenterologist following previously established criteria [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mucus production was quantified as a percentage of periodic-acid Schiff (PAS)-positive area in the BE region of at least 5 mice per intervention group and age cohort. For further phenotypic characterization, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Caspase 1, γ-H2AX, and Ki67, as well as in-situ hybridization (ISH) for Lgr5 in the BE region of at least 5 mice per intervention group and age cohort were performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>2.3. Microbiome Analysis</title><p>Amplifying the V3/V4 region of microbial 16s rRNA genes through 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis has been established as a standard approach to investigate the microbial diversity of samples [<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and was used in this work to assess diet-related changes in the gut microbiota. Fecal samples of CD and HFrD mice of different age stages (3–4, 6, and 9 months) were collected along the study and sent to the TUM Core Facility Microbiome for DNA isolation, 2-step-amplification-PCR-based library construction and sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA). To control for artifacts and ensure reproducibility between runs, two negative controls (a PCR control without template DNA and a DNA extraction control of 600 μL stool stabilizer without stool), as well as a positive control using a mock community (No. D6300, ZymoBIOMICS, Irvine, CA, USA) were included in every batch of 45 samples. Generated raw reads were assigned to their corresponding samples by using the barcode pairs unique to each of the samples (demultiplexing). Sequencing resulted in an average total number of 28,070 ± 9888 demultiplexed reads per sample. An average of 20,276 ± 7202 of raw reads per sample remained after filter trimming and removal of chimeras. The negative controls had 16 and 11 reads, respectively, after quality filtering, indicating no systematic contamination in the dataset. The final dataset comprised 385 zOTUs in 75 samples. Sequencing data were preprocessed using the IMNGS pipeline [<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Data processing was achieved by trimming five nucleotides on the 5′ end and 3′ end for the R1 and R2 read, respectively (trim score 5), and an expected error rate of 1 followed by chimera removal [<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] using the FASTQ mergepair script of USEARCH [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Quality filtered reads were merged, deduplicated, and clustered, and a denoised clustering approach was applied to generate zOTUs [<xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP classifier version 2.11 and confirmed using the SILVA database [<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. EzBioCloud database [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was used for precise identification of zOTU sequences of interest. The demultiplexed reads for all 16S amplicon sequencing datasets included in this manuscript are publicly available. Raw data of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive [<uri ns1:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/769229">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/769229</uri>; accessed on 7 October 2021] under the accession no. PRJNA769229. Software used to analyze the data is either freely or commercially available. The function prediction based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed by using PICRUSt2 [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To determine differences between the groups, the R package ALEDx2 was used [<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Predicted abundances were centered-log transformed, and significance was determined by using a generalized linear regression. Pairwise significance between visits, within one intervention group (Intervention or placebo), was assigned if the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 and effect size &gt;0.4. Centered-log-transformed values of the selected pathways were correlated with zOTUs with a relative abundance &gt;0.1 and a prevalence &gt;10%. zOTUs with a negative or positive correlation in at least one pairwise comparison &gt;0.5 and a significant <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 were selected to generate the heatmap. The functionality of the pathways found to be significantly different between the intervention groups or to be altered within the groups at different age stages was verified in the database MetaCyc. Additionally, aiming to identify features characterizing the differences [<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] between both intervention groups, we performed a LEfSe analysis at genera level. We then looked into the taxonomy browser of NCBI to check the taxonomy of the genera found to be enriched in the intervention groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>2.4.

Dietary elements not only have an effect on the host’s health, but also on intestinal microbiota [<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Results from this study revealed a diet-related alteration of the gut microbiota profile, together with decreasing microbial richness in HFrD mice. Similarly, in HFD-fed L2-IL1B mice, a diet-related alteration of the gut microbiota linked with BE progression was also found [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Obesity and Western-style diet have been previously linked with a shift in the gut microbiota, a reduction in Bacteroidetes, and increasing levels of Firmicutes [<xref rid="B43-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Fitting into this context, in HFrD-fed L2-IL1B mice, we found no significant reduction in Bacteroidia but increasing levels of Firmicutes. In regard to our results, the age-related increase in Firmicutes in HFrD-fed mice can be explained through the age-dependent increase in Clostridia and the enrichment of Firmicutes genera (<italic toggle="yes">Dubosiella, Erysipelotrichales, ASF356, Peptostreptococcaceae, Marvinbryantia</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Erysipelotrichaceae</italic>) in HFrD-fed mice. Clostridia and some members belonging to <italic toggle="yes">Eubacteria</italic> can metabolize primary bile acids to secondary bile acids [<xref rid="B44-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The increase in Clostridia might, thus, be related to increasing bile acid metabolization upon HFrD intake, consistent with the gene expression analyses of SCJ tissue from these mice. However, no changes in bile acid levels could be detected in untargeted metabolomic analyses. Within the Clostridia class, there are species shown to have beneficial health properties [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Considering this, the high relative abundance of Clostridia in HFrD-fed mice together with the fact that Clostridia negatively correlates with dysplasia and positively with GC ratio might explain the less pronounced acceleration of EAC progression in HFrD-fed mice.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Lactobacilli</italic> have gained attention as potential probiotics [<xref rid="B47-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Proportions of these bacteria in the colonic microbiota have been described to correlate both positively and negatively with disease and different types of cancer [<xref rid="B48-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In HFrD mice, we showed an age-dependent increase in <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> and observed that the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> positively correlated with inflammation and dysplasia. Together with decreasing lactic acid levels, these findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> strains promoting disease progression, but not the probiotic, lactic-acid-producing strains, expanded in the gut of HFrD mice. Linked with the decrease in Verrucomicrobiota in both intervention groups, we observed a drop in its genus <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic>, which has been described to be abundant in the gut of healthy subjects compared with obese patients or patients with metabolic syndrome. <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic> has also been identified as an important bacterium in the maintenance of gut mucosal integrity and defense against pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="B51-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

The significant age-dependent decrease in Akkermansia abundance in HFrD-fed mice might account for the reduction in SCFAs. In the same way, it might indicate an impaired gut health and instable mucus barrier, leading to increased translocation of bacteria and metabolites into blood circulation and, thus, supporting disease progression in HFrD-fed L2-IL1B mice. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic> negatively correlated with dysplasia and positively with GC ratio and was enriched in CD-fed mice, highlighting that the shift in the microbiota was caused by the high-fructose diet and had an impact on the host.</p><p>The significant upregulation of pathways associated with the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, NAD(P) coenzymes, folates, and menaquinones in HFrD-fed mice in comparison with CD-fed mice reveal a fructose-dependent alteration of the microbial communities in these mice. Niacin is a B vitamin, known by its coenzymes NAD and NAD(P), NAD being essential for the synthesis and repair of DNA [<xref rid="B53-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Folates are essential for vertebrates [<xref rid="B54-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and play a role in the biosynthesis of methionine, purine, and pyrimidine. Folate deficiency has been linked with multiple pathologies including cancer [<xref rid="B55-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Together with folates, menaquinones (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>) are also essential for animals and are produced by bacteria in the intestine [<xref rid="B56-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

On the contrary, the upregulation of pathways involved in the biosynthesis of potentially protective vitamins might explain the mild effect of fructose on the acceleration of EAC progression. </p><p>The observed pathway alteration within the microbial communities of HFrD-fed mice was mainly related to the biosynthesis of nucleic acids as well as to metabolic and anabolic pathways. While the activity of these pathways was higher in 3-month- and 9-month-old mice, it showed a relatively low activity in 6-month-old HFrD-fed mice. Despite the possibly related age-dependent shift in pathway activation to the accelerated dysplasia, reduced differentiation, and mucus production in the BE region of 6-month-old HFrD-fed mice, we cannot explain this contradictory trend.

Fructose overconsumption has been linked with prejudicial metabolic changes, mainly attributed to the role of fructose in de novo lipogenesis in the liver [<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B64-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To assess the metabolic effects of a high fructose intake, the expression of key enzymes of fructose metabolism in the colon and liver was evaluated in this study. Considering the reactions catalyzed by the enzymes found to be overexpressed in theses tissues, our data suggest that fructose presumptively leads to increased colonic gluconeogenesis in 6-month-old HFrD mice and increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis in 9-month-old HFrD mice. Interestingly, this would also explain why the liver of 9-month-old HFrD-fed mice was significantly heavier than the liver of age-matched controls.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>4.3. The Metabolic Profile of HFrD Mice Suggests a Diet-Related Alteration of Substrate Utilization by Host and Microbiome, as Well as a Limited Effect on Systemic Inflammation and Moderate Acceleration of the Dysplasia Phenotype</title><p>Untargeted metabolome analysis of feces, serum, and tissue revealed diet-specific changes in the metabolic profile of the mice. Deoxyhexoses were found in feces and serum of HFrD-fed mice. Deoxyhexoses are first metabolized into lactaldehyde, which depending on oxygen availability, can be reduced to 1,2-propanediol under anaerobic conditions or oxidized to lactate under aerobic conditions [<xref rid="B65-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. 1,2-propanediol can be metabolized through multiple steps into propionic acid [<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Intensity levels of deoxyhexoses in feces correlating with the concentration of propionic acid in the fecal samples of HFrD-fed mice suggest a bacteria-mediated anaerobic metabolization of the deoxyhexoses in the intestine of these mice [<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B65-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. On the contrary, intensity levels of deoxyhexoses in serum correlated with lactic acid concentrations in the serum of HFrD mice. Considering the metabolic fate of deoxyhexoses in an aerobic environment [<xref rid="B65-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and the role of blood as an oxygen carrier [<xref rid="B66-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], it can be assumed that the deoxyhexoses in the blood were further metabolized into lactic acid. Ketodisaccharides were found in fecal samples of only CD-fed mice. Certain bacteria are known to convert disaccharides into ketodisaccharides [<xref rid="B68-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Disaccharides, branched alpha-dextrins, and trisaccharides are degradation products of complex carbohydrates such as starch [<xref rid="B69-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Compared with the HFrD that only included single sugars and no complex sugars, the CD contained 45.9% of starch. The presence of ketodisaccharides in feces, as well as the enrichment of trisaccharides in the cardia tissue of CD-fed mice, can, thus, be associated with the dietary starch in CD. Moreover, hexoses enriched in the cardia tissue of HFrD-fed mice presumably indicate phenotypic deterioration in correlation with increased cellular energy turnover in BE epithelial cells, as often observed during carcinogenesis [<xref rid="B72-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. On the whole, untargeted metabolomic analysis indicates diet-related alterations in the metabolic profile, partially resulting from the microbial shift.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>4.4. Levels of Protectively Acting SCFA Are Decreased in HFrD</title><p>In targeted metabolomic analyses, we further examined SCFA levels in stool and serum of the mice. SCFAs are the main metabolites produced by bacterial anaerobic fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and proteins in the colon [<xref rid="B74-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. SCFAs function as systemic energy substrates with distinct metabolic roles [<xref rid="B75-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Acetic- and propionic acid can be absorbed from the colon and processed in the liver. While acetate is used as a substrate for fatty acid synthesis [<xref rid="B74-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], propionic acid has been shown to hinder this process [<xref rid="B74-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B77-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], reduce immune system recruitment, and improve tissue insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="B77-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Butyric acid is the preferred source of energy for colonocytes [<xref rid="B78-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It has a positive impact on genetic/epigenetic modulations, signaling pathways, and immune response and has antineoplastic features, especially in colon carcinoma [<xref rid="B75-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B78-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Isobutyric acid is generated by fermentation of branched amino acids from undigested proteins [<xref rid="B80-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. An increased colonic production of isobutyric and propionic acid has been associated with lowered glucose and insulin blood concentrations [<xref rid="B81-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Valeric acid is generated from amino acids and has antimicrobial features. Furthermore, the oral administration of valeric acid protected against gastrointestinal inflammation and gut dysbiosis in animal models fed a high-fat diet or subjected to irradiation [<xref rid="B82-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Compared with age-matched controls, we found that in HFrD-fed L2-IL1B mice, the concentration of these generally favorable SCFAs was reduced in fecal samples. Reduced levels of the different SCFAs in HFrD-fed mice was presumably the result of altered metabolic activity of the microbiota in HFrD mice. Butyric and lactic acid contents were also reduced in the serum of HFrD-fed compared with CD-fed mice. An overall reduction in SCFA indicates perturbation of the host metabolism by HFrD, as also found by gene expression analysis. The presence of SCFAs in the serum of the mice indicates a potential systemic effect of these metabolites by distribution via blood circulation, yet the role of SCFAs in disease progression in L2-IL1B mice is not yet clear. As SCFAs are microbially metabolized compounds, these findings correlate with our observations of a changed gut microbiome in HFrD-fed compared with CD-fed mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>4.5. HFrD-Fed Mice Present a Moderate Inflammatory Phenotype in Comparison with HFD-Fed Mice</title><p>Evaluating the immune phenotype of HFrD mice, we found an age-dependent increase in pro-tumorigenic neutrophils and γδ T cells in the cardia of HFrD-fed mice, with comparatively lower numbers of neutrophils in HFrD-fed compared with CD-fed mice. Considering that γδ T cells have been shown to act defensively against pathogens and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B83-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], this observation together with the finding of metabolites with anti-inflammatory potential in HFrD mice explains the limited effect of the diet on systemic inflammation. As inflammation was found to be a crucial factor for disease progression in BE, especially in the L2-IL1B model, this finding might explain the modest acceleration of the dysplasia phenotype in HFrD-fed mice compared with HFD-fed mice. In the HFD study, the inflammatory phenotype was massively enhanced by the diet, thus explaining pronounced acceleration of the phenotype in HFD mice [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>4.6. Tissue Remodeling, Metabolism, and Gut Barrier Protection Gene Sets Are Enriched in HFrD Mice While Pro-Oncogenic Gene Sets Are Enriched in CD Mice</title><p>To gain a better and deeper insight into molecular factors responsible for phenotypic changes between CD- and HFrD-fed mice, the gene expression profile in the SCJ was assessed. Significantly increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">Aldolase B</italic> suggests significantly increased fructose uptake of cells in the SCJ of HFrD-fed mice compared with controls. Enhanced energy metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer and, thus, correlates with promotion of the phenotype in HFrD mice. (PI3K)/AKT mTOR-, mTOR C1-signaling, and p53 signaling, which are involved in cell growth, survival, and replication, are often deregulated during carcinogenesis and were upregulated in CD-fed mice.

In HFrD-fed mice, genes involved in EMT, angiogenesis, and hedgehog signaling but also in ECM remodeling were enriched, indicating structural changes in the tissue microenvironment promoting malignant disease progression in correlation with increased dysplasia scores and stem cell numbers [<xref rid="B89-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="B90-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Hedgehog signaling is a key biological process involved in embryonic development, stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, and proliferation [<xref rid="B92-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Thus, the enrichment of genes involved in hedgehog signaling might explain the increased stem cell levels in the BE epithelium of HFrD-fed mice. Enrichment of genes involved in metabolic diseases and bile acid metabolism indicate promotion of a metabolic phenotype and increased bile acid production induced by diet-dependent enhanced de novo lipogenesis, with bile acids being associated with promotion of disease progression in BE and EAC [<xref rid="B93-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The gene expression profile of HFrD mice indicates higher metabolic activity and energy turnover in mice due to high sugar consumption. Enrichment of IgA production and O-linked glycosylation-associated pathways are presumptively protective reactions to changes in microbiome and nutrient availability through HFrD intake. Both pathways are important for tissue homeostasis. IgA is involved in non-inflammatory mucosal protection against microbial commensals, and O-linked glycosylation is a metabolic process involved in production of mucins, which protect the epithelial gut barrier, potentially due to the increased availability of sugar molecules [<xref rid="B94-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="B95-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Enrichment of these pathways indicates increased epithelial protection against microbiota and pathogens and might explain why the phenotype of HFrD-fed mice was not as pronounced as that seen in HFD-fed mice. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>A modern, westernized lifestyle includes a diet rich in both fat and sugars [<xref rid="B96-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], which along with obesity, coincide with the increase in prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) [<xref rid="B97-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,<xref rid="B98-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Although there are studies that have assessed esophageal microbiota and its changes along EAC progression [<xref rid="B99-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B100-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref rid="B101-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], little is known about the link between EAC progression and intestinal microbiota. Dietary factors are critical determinants of gut microbiota diversity and plasticity [<xref rid="B102-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Fat intake has long been the focus of research. However, research on the consequences of chronically high sugar consumption has recently been gaining more attention [<xref rid="B103-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,<xref rid="B104-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Saccharose and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are the most commonly used types of refined sugar in the food industry [<xref rid="B104-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Modelling the effects of fructose overconsumption on the BE-mouse model, we found that a HFrD accelerated the phenotypic progression of BE to dysplasia in correlation with reduced differentiation and enhanced Lgr5 stem cell expansion, especially in younger animals. However, these effects were less pronounced than those seen in HFD-fed IL-1B [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We also found a limited impact of HFrD feeding on the inflammatory phenotype in comparison with CD-fed mice. Similar to findings in HFD-fed mice, in HFrD-fed mice, we found effects on the gut, serum, and tissue metabolome, as well as diet-induced alterations of the composition, functionality, and metabolism of intestinal microbial communities. Our findings underline the impact of dietary patterns on the health and balance of the metaorganism. The outcomes from this study in addition to the HFD study [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] provide important insights into the ways in which diet might influence disease progression and highlight the effect of diet on the intestinal microbiota profile and balance in the BE-mouse model. However, studying dietary patterns rather than individual dietary components would better capture the complex effects of dietary habits [<xref rid="B105-microorganisms-09-02432" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] on EAC. A further limitation of this study is the use of a mouse model. Despite the importance of mice in biomedical research, the bench-to-bed translational power of mouse studies is arguable, since mice differ from humans in many aspects. Furthermore, we only looked for diet-related changes in the intestinal microbiota and not in the esophageal microbiota itself. Although the effect of targeting the intestinal microbiota or its metabolism as prophylactic or therapeutic approaches for EAC is unclear, it is evident that diet has an impact on the overall health of the host and the balance of its microbiome. In addition to gaining a better understanding of the effects of diet on noncommunicable diseases such as EAC, it is necessary to actively encourage people to strive for a healthy, non-sedentary lifestyles, maintain a balanced diet, and, thus, reduce the risk of NCDs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher’s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-microorganisms-09-02432"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri ns1:href="https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms9122432/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms9122432/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Diet, dietary preferences, body-, liver- and spleen-weight, and macroscopic tumor score; Figure S2: Caspase1-, yH2AX- and Ki67-positive cells in the BE region; Figure S3: Further details of microbiome characterization; Figure S4: Simplified graphical representation of the fructose and glucose metabolism and relative expression of enzymes relevant for fructose metabolism; Figure S5: Gating flowchart of (A) myeloid cell populations and (B) T cell populations; Figure S6: Heatmaps of metabolic signaling enriched in HFrD mice and pro-oncogenic genesets in CD identified by GSEA.

Conversely, in the low-MCL-1 cell line (NCI-H2170) BIM<sub>S</sub>BAD was more effective than BIM<sub>S</sub>2A in eliciting cell death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d, e</xref>). As expected, BIM<sub>S</sub>WT was the most effective in inducing apoptosis in all cell lines tested. This suggests that the survival of these lung cancer-cell lines is safeguarded by two or more pro-survival BCL-2 proteins with MCL-1 or BCL-XL being the dominant factor.

This could therefore simply reflect increased chromosomal instability. However, conceivably, this could also indicate that higher levels of MCL-1 are selected for by the tumour cells in response to mounting oncogenic stress that occurs when <italic>TP53</italic> is mutated.

Therefore we aimed to analyze the expression of SCFAs sensing G-protein coupled receptor GPR109A and GPR43 by quantitative PCR in 338 gastrointestinal (GI) biopsies obtained from 199 adult patients undergoing allo-SCT and assessed the interaction of GPR with FOXP3 expression and regulatory T cell infiltrates. GPR expression was strongly upregulated in patients with stage II-IV GvHD (p=0.000 for GPR109A, p=0.01 for GPR43) and at the onset of GvHD (p 0.000 for GPR109A, p=0.006 for GPR43) and correlated strongly with FOXP3 and NLRP3 expression. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) drastically suppressed GPR expression as well as FOXP3 expression in patients’ gut biopsies (p=0.000 for GPRs, FOXP3 mRNA and FOXP3+ cellular infiltrates). Logistic regression analysis revealed treatment with Abx as an independent factor associated with GPR and FOXP3 loss. The upregulation of GPRs was evident only in the absence of Abx (p=0.001 for GPR109A, p=0.014 for GPR43) at GvHD onset. Thus, GPR expression seems to be upregulated in the presence of commensal bacteria and associates with infiltration of FOXP3+ T regs, suggesting a protective, regenerative immunomodulatory response. However, Abx, which has been shown to induce dysbiosis, interferes with this protective response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>broad-spectrum antibiotics</kwd><kwd>GPR</kwd><kwd>Foxp3</kwd><kwd>GvHD</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>SCFA</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8" /><table-count count="1" /><equation-count count="0" /><ref-count count="51" /><page-count count="13" /><word-count count="5868" /></counts></article-meta></front><body><fig position="float" id="d95e282"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><caption><p> G-protein coupled receptor (GPR109A, GPR43 and GPR41) is predominantly expressed on epithelial and immune cells. GPR is activated by its ligand short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In absence of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx), beneficial commensals produce SCFAs that activate GPR pathway. SCFA engage GPR-NLRP3 pathway for the maintainance of epithelial barrier. SCFA also engage GPR on immune cells to induce regulatory T cells. Patients who do not receive Abx show an upregulation of GPR expression in the presence of aGvHD suggesting a counterregulatory mechanism. Abx suppresses commensals leading to reduced SCFA hence less GPR. GPR-NLRP3 axis and GPR-Tregs axis are strongly abrogated by Abx. Abx also interfere with the upregulation of GPR during aGvHD.</p></caption><graphic ns0:href="fimmu-12-753287-g008" position="float" /></fig><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute Graft versus host disease (aGvHD) is the major cause of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Current treatment options for this complication are poor if initial treatment with steroids has failed (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Landmark studies in the early 70s by van Bekkum already pointed to a role of the intestinal microflora in gastrointestinal (GI) aGvHD (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and suggested protection of germfree mice from GvHD. Preclinical and clinical studies therefore introduced prophylactic use of decontamination as an approach to reduce GvHD (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and together with the concept of prevention of neutropenic gram-negative infections, antibiotic prophylaxis has become standard of care (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) With the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies including 16s rRNA, it now became evident that the intestinal microbiota is an important modulator of aGvHD. Since 2012, several studies using this technique in experimental (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and clinical settings (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported a strong loss of commensal bacteria (dysbiosis) but no complete decontamination and an association of dysbiosis with the occurrence of GI aGvHD as well as several severe infectious complications following allogeneic SCT. Prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics were even identified as the major driver of dysbiosis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and these findings more and more questioned at least prophylactic concepts. Recent reports also suggested that even the reconstitution of commensal bacteria by fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) contributes favorably to the treatment of patients (pts) with steroid-refractory aGvHD (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of how commensal intestinal microbiota dampens intestinal inflammation in general and in the setting of aGvHD are still poorly understood. Microbial metabolites that are produced by commensal bacteria after digestion of dietary fibers, tryptophan, and other sources have been identified as major protective molecules that act as mediators of pathogen-host interaction and exert protective functions. In this context, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) like butyrate and propionate are not only a major energy source for colonocytes but also stabilize the epithelium and dampen immune reactions by multiple mechanisms including regulation of Nlrp3-inflammasome dependent inflammation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and by induction of regulatory T cells (T regs) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Indoles derived from dietary tryptophan stabilize the epithelium <italic>via</italic> induction of interleukin 22 in innate lymphoid cells and modulate inflammation by inducing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Strong protection against aGvHD by the tryptophan-metabolite Indol-3-carboxaldehyde (ICA) was observed in Swimm´s study (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) as gavage with ICA reduced aGvHD mortality to a large extent in a type I Interferon (IFN-I) dependent manner while maintaining graft-versus-leukemia activity.</p><p>As all these mechanisms have been reported to modify GvHD, it is not surprising that experimental reports found significant protection from GvHD by these metabolites. Mathewson and colleagues applied butyrate gavage and a cocktail of commensal clostridia known to be high SCFA producers in a murine model of GvHD and reported strong protection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Recently, the same group addressed the role of SCFA by using knockout mice for one of the receptors of SCFA, G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 43, and reported that GPR43 knockout on non-hematopoietic cells led to accelerated and increased GvHD related mortality (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In humans, a comparable role of SCFA is likely and suggested by a recent analysis of Romick-Rosendale et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) who reported reduced stool SCFAs after exposure to Abx suppressing commensals in children receiving HSCT but so far no data have been reported regarding the expression of GPR in adult human GvHD. We, therefore, performed an analysis of expression of the major SCFA receptors GPR43 and GPR109A by quantitative PCR in intestinal biopsies obtained from pts receiving allogeneic SCT at our unit. We observed upregulation of GPR in aGvHD which was strongly suppressed by broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>338 serial biopsies were obtained and analyzed from a total of 199 adult patients (pts) receiving allogeneic SCT between Nov 2008 and Nov 2015.

The third group had Abx at the time of biopsy but no early exposure. The fourth group had both early Abx exposure and at the time of biopsy.

This may result from previously reported rapid loss of commensals after Abx treatment to pts and is reflected by reduced GPR expression in the gut biopsies. When we grouped pts according to the clinical GI-aGvHD status at the time of biopsies (GI-aGvHD free screening biopsies and aGvHD clinical onset biopsies) and further re-grouped them again according to the use of Abx, our findings were confirmed in the serial biopsies. Pts who did not receive Abx showed significant increases in GPR at the onset of aGvHD (p=0.001 for GPR109A, p=0.014 for GPR43) whereas pts with Abx did not show GPR upregulation at the aGvHD onset (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">

Butyrate toxicity was excluded by MTT assay (data not shown). In absence of stimulation, Caco-2 (control) cells did not produce cytokines. IL-1 β stimulation was a pre- requisite for cytokine production by Caco-2 cells. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 and IL-6 by Caco-2 cells was significantly suppressed on both apical and basolateral side of the transwell system by the addition of butyrate (stim+butyrate) when compared to stimulated condition (stim) (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">

An imbalance or maladaptations of these essential microorganisms, also termed dysbiosis, has been linked to numerous intestinal disorders including GvHD. Several studies have confirmed a strong association of microbiota damage with the occurrence of GvHD and associated transplant-related complications (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Microbiota-derived SCFA such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate have been described in previous studies to be the key modulator of inflammation and GvHD by promoting anti-inflammatory myeloid cells and by maintaining epithelial barrier integrity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). These studies also revealed the involvement of G-protein coupled receptors GPR109A, GPR43, and GPR41 in the mitigation of GvHD. However, these studies were performed in mice and no data have previously been reported regarding the role of GPR expression in adult human GvHD.</p><p>Our clinical data show an increased expression of GPR43 and GPR109A in patients (pts) suffering from GvHD. Especially during GvHD onset or at higher grade GI-GvHD (Lerner II-IV), GPR expression was significantly enhanced. This might reflect a counter-regulatory mechanism of protective GPR signaling that is reactively induced to suppress T cell-mediated injury. There are only a few studies discussing counter-regulatory mechanisms in the gut of GvHD pts (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Landfried et al. showed an increase of IDO in the lower GI tract of GvHD pts (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) while Lord et al. showed an increase of FOXP3 Tregs in the gastric biopsies of GvHD pts (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Takatsuka et al. showed significant increase of plasma IL-10 in GvHD patients (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We speculate that the actual increase in regulatory parameters such as IDO, FOXP3, IL-10, and GPR in GvHD is a physiological counter-reaction to suppress the various inflammatory reactions going on in patients’ system. In addition, it is known that inflammatory stimuli such as TNF, IL-1, LPS or GM-CSF can induce GPR expression on monocytes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and macrophages (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the induction of GPR is, in part, the result of elevated inflammation in GvHD.</p><p>Commensal bacteria are the most prominent SCFA producers and have been reported to be suppressed after antibiotic treatment (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We recently demonstrated that Abx suppresses butyrogeneic bacteria that are responsible for SCFA production (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Consistently, we found that (i) SCFAs induce GPR expression in human colon cell lines and mDCs and (ii) Abx significantly suppressed GPR expression in the intestinal biopsies of allo-SCT pts. Utilizing a regression model, Abx suppressed GPR expression independent of GvHD. Herein, we propose that the detrimental effect of Abx are confined not only to loss of commensals following reduction of SCFA but also to the loss of GPR expression. Cumulative and long-term antibiotic exposure revealed that GPR expression was highest in pts who did not receive Abx either before/at transplantation or before biopsy retrieval. On contrary, the lowest GPR expression was observed in pts who received Abx before transplantation and also at the time of biopsy indicating persistent long-term dysbiosis by cumulative ABX exposure. The fact that GPR upregulates in GvHD onset pts only in the absence of Abx but not in presence of Abx implicates the potentially protective “commensal-SCFA-GPR” axis in GvHD patients which is clearly abrogated by Abx.</p><p>SCFAs have been reported to expand regulatory T cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and these cells prevent GvHD and promote immune reconstitution (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We, therefore, addressed the interrelation of GPR and FOXP3 expression. We observed a high correlation between GPR and FOXP3 expression on mRNA level which was also confirmed in pts where immune cell infiltrates were directly stained for FOXP3 and the positive cells were counted in high power field (HPF). Strong association of GPR with Treg infiltrates point towards the GPR-FOXP3 axis that is again abrogated by the use of Abx. In addition, we saw a negative correlation between Abx use and FOXP3 expression suggesting a link between microbiota changes and immunoregulation although the exact pathways linking ABX use and FOXP3 suppression need to be further analyzed. As we used single antibody staining for our immunohistological analysis of FOXP3+ cells, we are thus far unable to further characterize the Treg subpopulations in more detail. In the clinical setting, it is still unclear whether both natural and induced Tregs are affected by SCFA and future studies using multiplex staining are required to address these questions.</p><p>Previous murine studies reported that the salutary effect of GPR in mitigating GvHD occurred <italic>via</italic> non-hematopoietic cells, namely intestinal epithelial cells in an NLRP3 dependent fashion (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In line with murine data, we also observed a strong association of NLRP3 with GPR expression in patient gut biopsies supporting the GPR regulation in epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence revealed intestinal epithelial cells as one of the cellular sources of GPR43 within the non-hematopoietic compartment which is in line with a previous study (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In an intestinal epithelial cell line model, butyrate suppressed inflammatory cytokine release, rescued the damaged epithelial barrier and increased GPR43 expression indicating the positive feedback loop of ligand-receptor interaction. Within the hematopoietic compartment, CD68 positive macrophages coexpressed GPR43. Previous murine and human studies described leukocyte subpopulation as a source of GPR43 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Immune cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils likely play an inevitable role in GPR-mediated protection from GvHD and antibiotic treatment abrogates the necessary protective phenomenon due to dysbiosis, or, by inhibiting the bacterial translocation that would otherwise induce immune responses. Upon treatment with SCFA, in-vitro generated mDCs showed increased expression of GPR109A and GPR43 followed by reduced pro-inflammatory IL-12 and an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine release pointing towards the immunoregulatory phenomenon of SCFA and are in line with previous reports where bacterial metabolite exerted immune regulation by modulating antigen-presenting cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In our study, pts showed higher expression of both GPR in the ileum and there was a gradual recovery of GPR over the time after transplantation implicating the role of hematopoietic cells and recovering epithelial tissue. Our data is in line with previous murine studies that reported the involvement of immune cells in GPR-mediated protection against inflammation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Our study has some limitations. We were not able to directly assess microbiome status at the time of biopsy retrieval. This limited simultaneous analysis of GPR expression and microbial diversity and prompted us to use antibiotic treatment as a surrogate in the clinical settings of GvHD. Furthermore, epithelial interactions of SCFA with GPR are likely to be directly influenced by luminal metabolites of commensals, however, we do not know yet about the exact role of translocated bacteria and tissue metabolites which are likely to play an additional role due to the leakiness of epithelia in GvHD and tissue immune regulation (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Nevertheless, our study is the first to address the interaction of microbiota and regulation of adaptive immune responses in human tissue biopsies of SCT pts. So far, only stimulation of peripheral blood Tregs has been reported in pts receiving fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from healthy donors for treatment of refractory GvHD (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), thus both observations point to the fact that a diverse microbiota is needed to mount an adequate Treg cell response. Whether the observed association of GPR and FOXP3 expression is due to a direct effect of SCFA on Tregs induction, e.g. <italic>via</italic> HDAC inhibition as reported in an earlier study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), or involves further mediators released by immune or epithelial cells, needs further investigation. The negative impact of antibiotic treatment on Treg cell response in tissues has so far been reported outside HSCT models. An association of early-life antibiotic exposure and the development of experimental asthma in murine models have been observed (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In a murine model of pulmonary metastases, antibiotic treatment reduced T regs and increased the cytotoxic T cell response (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Similarly, experimental FMT has been shown to increase Treg cell frequencies in the gut which were diminished after Abx exposure (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Overall, our observations are in line with the protective effects of high SCFA producing commensals in HSCT-associated complications and support the concept that microbiota restoration, e.g. by FMT may be beneficial in GvHD pts. So far, only a small and casuistic series of successful FMTs in clinical GvHD has been reported, but thoroughly designed clinical trials are now initiated to examine the exact contribution of microbiota reconstitution by FMT or more specific consortia of commensals to immunomodulation of GvHD.</p><p>To conclude, our data suggest so far neglected but deleterious effects of Abx on GPR expression and immunoregulation in clinical GvHD. We urge the need for microbiota preservation or restoration either by FMT, transfer of protective commensal consortia or by fiber-rich diet (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In addition, our data strongly suggest restrictive use of Abx and support careful antibiotic stewardship to maintain microbiota, metabolites, receptors, and immunoregulation. This approach might be relevant for GvHD prophylaxis and treatment as well as several other diseases where dysbiosis is concerned.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">

While the theoretical diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences is vast, the antigen-specific TCR repertoire is restricted by its peptide epitope and the presenting major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). It remains unclear how many TCR sequences are recruited into an antigen-specific T cell response, both within and across different organisms, and which factors shape both of these distributions. Infection of mice with ovalbumin-expressing cytomegalovirus (IE2-OVA-mCMV) represents a well-studied model system to investigate T cell responses given their size and longevity. Here we investigated &gt; 180,000 H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL-recognizing TCR CDR3α or CDR3β sequences from 25 individual mice spanning seven different time points during acute infection and memory inflation. In-depth repertoire analysis revealed that from a pool of highly diverse, but overall limited sequences, T cell responses were dominated by public clonotypes, partly with unexpectedly extreme degrees of sharedness between individual mice (“supra-public clonotypes”). Public clonotypes were found exclusively in a fraction of TCRs with a high generation probability. Generation probability and degree of sharedness select for highly functional TCRs, possibly mediated through elevating intraindividual precursor frequencies of clonotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>memory inflation</kwd><kwd>public clonotypes</kwd><kwd>generation probability</kwd><kwd>T cell response</kwd><kwd>TCR</kwd><kwd>convergent recombination</kwd><kwd>TCR repertoire</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pathogens-09-00650"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>T cells play a crucial role in the control of chronic and latent infections. Latent infection with CMV affects 60–100% of the general population [<xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]—largely depending on the socioeconomic status—but does not cause any symptoms unless the immune system is compromised. In immunosuppressed patients, for example hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients, CMV is indeed a major cause of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The significance of T cell mediated protection from overt CMV infection is further strongly supported by adoptive transfer experiments in mice [<xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and through the success of adoptive T cell therapy in human patients [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In immunocompetent individuals, viral latency and immune control seem to be in equilibrium. On the T cell side, this equilibrium is maintained by antigen-specific populations that can become extremely large (“inflationary T cells”) [<xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Inflationary T cells often harbor a senescent phenotype [<xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and an overall skewed CD4/CD8 ratio. Such a CMV-induced so-called immune risk phenotype [<xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] has been associated with increased mortality in the elderly [<xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Overall, the protective importance, size and longevity of CMV-specific T cells raise an intriguing question—at what cost does the immune system dedicate so much of its capacity to target individual CMV antigens [<xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]? Furthermore, however, these aspects have also made CMV T cell immunity an attractive model system to investigate acute and chronic T cell responses in general.</p><p>Since CMV-specific T cell responses have been studied so deeply, a surprising finding became apparent early on: CMV-specific T cell populations often contain public clonotypes, i.e., T cell clones that occur in more than a single individual [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is astonishing as it is a canonical feature of the adaptive immune system to be programmed by non-self antigens only and the TCR recombination process has been long believed to be random. In order to mediate robust protection against a plethora of different and unknown foreign antigens, a highly diverse TCR repertoire is needed [<xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. V(D)J recombination, deletions and additions of individual nucleotides in the CDR3 region of the TCR variable chains, as well as differential pairing of α and β chains, yield a theoretical diversity of up to 10<sup>20</sup> or in some estimates even 10<sup>61</sup> different solutions for TCRs [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The actual diversity in a single mouse [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or human being [<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] is considerably lower, but still believed to be in the range of about 10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> unique TCRs. It remains largely unanswered how many TCRs fit to a given antigen in principle (across different individuals) and how many TCRs contribute to an antigen-specific T cell response in a single individual.</p><p>If the number of structural solutions of a TCR to a given epitope is finite, it is intuitive that clonotypes would re-occur, rendering them public. Even more importantly, the theoretical TCR repertoire is in reality highly skewed, since generation probabilities for individual TCRs are highly heterogenous (“TCR generation bias”) [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, it has been experimentally shown that the degree of sharedness of public clonotypes is associated with its generation probability. This phenomenon of high generation probabilities leading to public clonotypes has been termed “convergent recombination” [<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>While there are indications that public clonotypes are found disproportionately often in CMV antigen-specific T cell responses, few studies have investigated the degree of “degree of sharedness”, i.e., in how many different individuals do public clonotypes re-occur [<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further, it is unclear how dominant such public clonotypes are within CMV-specific immune responses. A recent study showed that public clonotypes are dominant in inflationary CMV-specific T cell populations, but this work only investigated very late time points of infection, did not take into account different degrees of sharedness and calculated generation probability merely by distance from germline [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In recent years, computation of generation probabilities became significantly more refined and can now also take into account biochemical features of CDR3 sequences, such as hydrophobicity of amino acids at certain positions or common motifs [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We have previously performed in-depth repertoire sequencing of CMV antigen-specific T cell populations from 25 mice spanning seven different time points during acute infection with murine CMV and memory inflation [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We now further investigated the obtained 42,154 CDR3α and 139,374 CDR3β sequences with respect to their public occurrence (including quantitative analysis of the degree of sharedness between individual mice) and their generation probability. This analysis revealed that while there is an astonishingly high overall number of unique CDR3 sequences within the antigen-specific pool, dominant clonotypes are highly enriched for public clones, most notably clones with very high degrees of sharedness (“supra-public clonotypes”) and high generation probabilities. While it remains an intriguing speculation that the TCR recombination machinery may “foresee” which specificities would be highly useful in the fight against pathogens [<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we hypothesize that robust recruitment may simply be a result of higher precursor numbers in the antigen-unexperienced repertoire.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2. Results</title><p>We infected C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a tissue culture-derived Smith mCMV strain expressing OVA under the IE2 promotor (IE2-OVA-mCMV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), which led to inflationary T cell responses against OVA [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. All mice were infected at the age of seven weeks. Half of the mice had been previously thymectomized at the age of four weeks in order to investigate how the TCR repertoire evolved from a narrower precursor repertoire and deduct the influence of recent thymic emigrants on the inflationary T cell population. The success of thymectomy was controlled by qPCR for TCR excision circles [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. All mice were distributed across two independent experimental cohorts (two non-thymectomized cohorts, two thymectomized cohorts). We sorted the H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL-specific CD8+ T cell population from peripheral blood by flow cytometry at day 7, 15, 30, 58, 86, 120 and 170 post infection with sort purities of at least 99.5% [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Following RNA extraction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR, CDR3α and CDR3β bulk sequencing was performed. Sequences were considered only if an intact unique molecular identifier (UMI) was present and found more than once in a given sample. Clonotypes were defined as chains with identical CDR3 amino acid sequences. For further details see Materials and Methods and references [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.1. TCR Repertoire Evolution Stabilizes during Memory Inflation</title><p>Diversity can be assessed with a focus on the evenness of the distribution or the richness of unique samples. In relation to TCR repertoires, a repertoire can be diverse when TCR clones are evenly distributed despite a low number of unique samples or it can be diverse in terms of richness with a high number of unique samples even though samples are distributed in a very skewed manner. We first evaluated the evenness of TCR repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The evenness in both non-thymectomized and thymectomized animals decreased over time. The greatest loss in diversity was observed during the first 60 days, whereas thereafter the evenness stayed fairly stable. This is consistent with the outgrowth of stable dominating clonotypes during memory inflation [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The evenness in thymectomized animals was generally lower than in non-thymectomized animals. This difference was already apparent at day 7 post infection. Since thymectomy took place three weeks before infection, this could indicate that a narrower precursor repertoire in thymectomized animals is driven into more accentuated clonal selection early on. To investigate this more closely, we analyzed the cumulative number of unique CDR3β sequences over time for each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). The number of unique clones was only slightly elevated in non-thymectomized compared to thymectomized mice in the early phase of the immune response, but a richer repertoire was maintained throughout the chronic phase of infection. The decreased evenness in thymectomized animals can therefore not be simply explained by a narrower precursor repertoire in terms of unique clones. The decreased richness in thymectomized animals over time speaks for less efficient recruitment of new antigen-specific T cells. This could argue for recruitment of naïve T cells into the inflationary T cell response in non-thymectomized animals, but would also be in line with a defect of nourishment from a pool of memory T cells only becoming apparent at later time points of the immune response [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The repertoire evolution with regards to evenness, richness and qualitative clonal succession [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] can be seen in two representative mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>d).</p><p>The plateau of unique CDR3 sequences at late time points indicates a limited absolute number of antigen-specific unique clonotypes within a given mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). In an individual non-thymectomized mouse, we found around 200 unique CDR3α (data not shown) and around 400 CDR3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) sequences on average. These numbers were reduced in thymectomized mice. It is likely that these numbers represent an underestimate of the absolute number of antigen-specific clonotypes within a mouse. Two important reasons for this are the fact that a given CDR3β sequence can differentially pair with CDR3α sequences and that repertoire analysis was conducted from a small fraction (around 100 µl) of peripheral blood. The confounding effect of the sampling bias should be, however, alleviated through repetitive sampling over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). Importantly, the plateau of unique CDR3 sequences at late time points also confirmed that our repertoire analysis was highly constricted to the antigen-specific pool as, e.g., sort impurities would have led to sequencing of random clonotypes and thereby continuously increased the number of overall unique CDR3 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.2. Public Clonotypes Lead to Repertoire Saturation across Individual Mice</title><p>Of all unique clonotypes, about a third of CDR3α and a quarter of CDR3β sequences were “public”, which means that they occurred in more than one mouse at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). In addition to the mere information whether a clonotype was public or not, our standardized repertoire analysis in at least 12 mice per treatment allowed us to investigate the degree of sharedness. While 1939 unique CDR3α and 4225 unique CDR3β sequences were private, we also found CDR3α and CDR3β sequences across the entire spectrum of sharedness, including 10 CDR3α sequences found in 10/12 non-thymectomized mice and 36 unique CDR3β sequences found in 12/12 non-thymectomized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>b).</p><p>These data indicate that the overall TCR repertoire against SIINFEKL is diverse but limited. The presence of extreme “supra-public” clonotypes prompted us to investigate whether we could observe saturation effects when adding individual mouse repertoires cumulatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>c–f). If there were no public clones, with each added mouse repertoire the number of cumulative unique CDR3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d) or CDR3α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f) sequences would rise infinitely without saturation (gray data points and lines indicate an according simulation, treating public clones from the experimental data as private). Since in the experimental data we do see a substantial degree of sharedness, the cumulative numbers of unique CDR3 sequences start to fall below the “private only simulation diagonal” already within the 12 investigated TCR repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,e). We wondered whether we could make an extrapolation from these data to obtain a ballpark figure at which cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences there would be a plateau, provided an infinite number of mice were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>d,f). To this end, we fitted the data to a simple saturation equation, Y = Bmax*X/(Kd + X), in which Y is the cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences and X is the number of cumulative mouse repertoires. Bmax then indicates the saturated number of unique CDR3 sequences if an infinite number of mice was studied and Kd indicates the number of mice that is needed to observe 50% of Bmax. With this approach, we would observe saturation at a little less than 60,000 CDR3β sequences and a little less than 6000 CDR3α sequences. While 100 mice (=Kd) would need to be studied to see half of the overall maximum of CDR3β sequences, 41 mice would need to be studied in case of CDR3α. It is important to stress that the exact numbers should not be overinterpreted as our approach is prone to several confounding factors. While we did use UMI in our sequencing approach (reducing the likelihood for sequencing error bias), sequencing from peripheral blood is inherently subject to sampling bias. Furthermore, we did not perform αβ pairing analysis and our PCR was based on a RACE PCR protocol, making abundance estimates from bulk sequencing data unprecise, which would however be important for precise extrapolation of “unseen species”. These considerations are well-described challenges [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Throughout our analyses, we only analyzed clonotypes with a UMI &gt; 1. When we set additional filters with threshold clone fractions (i.e., when we only analyzed clones that showed a minimum clone fraction), Bmax decreased with increasingly strict filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>g). Remarkably, Kd remained rather stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>h).</p><p>Overall, the data do allow us to draw two general conclusions: first, the number of unique clonotypes for H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL is highly diverse, but limited to an extent that makes reliable estimation of absolute numbers feasible for future investigation. Second, the number of unique SIINFEKL-specific CDR3α sequences is lower than the number of unique CDR3β sequences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.3. (Supra-) Public Clonotypes Are Preferentially Expanded during the Immune Response</title><p>Next, we investigated whether public clones are also preferentially recruited into the immune response. While evidence for this has been collected before, previous analyses were mostly confined to individual time points and investigated only private vs. public clones in general [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], thereby not incorporating the resolution of differential degrees of sharedness over the entire course of an immune response. Since the CDR3β repertoire is more diverse than the CDR3α repertoire and at the same time less prone to bias through second chains from non-excluded alleles, we focused our analyses from hereon on CDR3β sequences. We first looked at all clonotypes from all time points and mice pooled to obtain a broad overview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The median clone fraction (i.e., the fraction to which a clone contributes to the antigen-specific T cell response in a given mouse and at a given time point) of public clonotypes (degree of sharedness &gt; 1) was generally about one order of magnitude higher than the median clone fraction of private clonotypes (degree of sharedness = 1). While the median clone fraction did not differ further among different degrees of sharedness, individual clones with a clone fraction &gt; 0.2 mostly had a degree of sharedness of at least 5/12. Particularly supra-public clones with a degree of sharedness of 12/12 massively contributed to the overall immune response. Next, we concatenated the clonotypes with a given degree of sharedness for each mouse, and investigated the fraction of all unique CDR3β sequences and the sum of all clone fractions that would be represented by clones with a given degree of sharedness at day 15 and at day 120 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). While private clones constituted about 70% of all unique CDR3β sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, top left panel), they only contributed about 15% to the overall clone fraction at day 15 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, top right panel). Supra-public clonotypes with a degree of sharedness of 12/12 in turn contributed about 15% to the overall clone fraction, but only constituted 2% of unique CDR3β sequences to begin with. These data indicate preferential expansion of public clonotypes (in particular supra-public clonotypes with extreme degrees of sharedness).</p><p>Compared to day 15 post infection, at day 120 private clonotypes constituted less unique CDR3β sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, bottom panels). This indicates that during memory inflation, public clones are not only more likely to expand, but also more likely to be detectable at all. Next, we plotted the mean degree of sharedness of individual mouse repertoires over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Due to preferential expansion of (supra-)public clonotypes, the mean degree of sharedness was at around 5/12 already at day 7 post infection. The mean degree of sharedness rose to a little more than 6/12 from day 15 post infection onwards. In individual mice, the mean degree of sharedness fell again at late time points of infection due to the fact that, by chance, stable dominators were selected during memory inflation which showed partly low degrees of sharedness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>d and [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for illustration of stable dominators after day 58 post infection). Across all mice the median of the mean degree of sharedness was rather stable at a remarkably high value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>c).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.4. TCR Generation Probability Is Linked with Degree of Sharedness and Thereby Clonal Expansion</title><p>Differential generation probabilities of TCR sequences could be an explanation for differential degrees of sharedness. We therefore calculated generation probabilities for each amino acid clonotype using the OLGA algorithm (taking into account, among others, preferential VDJ pairing, the number of required insertions and deletions and motifs) [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Clonotypes with extremely low generation probabilities (&lt;10<sup>−25</sup>) were found exclusively for private clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Since there are also more private than public clonotypes, we calculated the median generation probability. Irrespective of whether clonotypes were included for which no generation probability could be calculated (presumably, but not necessarily, because it was too low; gen prob = “0”), the median generation probability rose from private to public clonotypes by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b). Nearly all of the clonotypes for which no generation probability could be calculated were private, which explains why the median shifted the most for private clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>b).</p><p>During the course of the immune response, clones with extremely low generation probabilities were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). Also, clones with a minimum degree of clone fraction showed a threshold generation probability. Clones with a clone fraction of &gt; 0.1 at any time point had a minimum generation probability of 10<sup>−17</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). Since mostly clones with a high generation probability expanded, the mean generation probability was as high as 10<sup>−6</sup>, which did not change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>e). This was further confirmed by focusing on the dominating clones at the peak of the acute immune response (day 15 post infection) and during memory inflation (day 120 post infection). The dominating clones (i.e., clones with a clone fraction &gt; 0.1) had exclusively very high generation probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>f). These high generation probabilities led in most cases to very high degrees of sharedness (median of 7 for day 15 and day 120 post infection). In turn, clones with a high degree of sharedness and/or generation probability represented higher median clone fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>g). We therefore finally explored whether generation probability and degree of sharedness could serve as predictors of TCRs that clonally expand within an antigen-specific immune response. In fact, both generation probability and degree of sharedness independently selected for clones with a higher clone fraction, with the combination of both parameters being the filter with the highest enrichment of expanding clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>h). Among supra-public clonotypes with a generation probability of 10<sup>−7</sup> there was a 18.8% hit rate of clones with a clone fraction &gt; 0.1. This hit rate is 0.2% without any filter, indicating a 94-fold enrichment of clones that will at some point contribute more than 10% (clone fraction of &gt; 0.1) to an overall antigen-specific T cell response.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.5. The Nucleotide-to-Amino Acid Ratio of Intraindividual TCR Sequences Is Associated with Interindividual Degrees of Sharedness via Generation Probability</title><p>It was previously speculated that the TCR generation machinery could have evolved in a manner that TCRs with high functionality against foreign epitopes are preferentially generated [<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This hypothesis is intriguing, but hard to confirm experimentally. An alternative explanation why TCRs with high generation probability are not only shared among many different individuals, but also robustly expand, is that high generation probabilities lead to repeated generation of the same clonotype within a given individual, thereby increasing the precursor frequencies of antigen-specific T cells in the naïve repertoire. We have previously shown how tightly increased precursor frequencies are linked to the robustness of antigen-specific T cell expansion [<xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For CDR3 nucleotide sequence copies it is not possible to deduct whether these sequences are derived from true clones (progeny of the same single cell) or if, by chance, the same nucleotide sequence has been generated twice. Functionally, however, TCRs are only determined through their amino acid sequence and due to the degeneracy of the base triplet code, the same CDR3 amino acid sequence can be generated through different nucleotide sequence variants (in fact, such convergence of different nucleotide sequences into one CDR3 amino acid sequence is an important parameter of the computation of CDR3 sequence generation probabilities [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p><p>We calculated for each clonotype how many nucleotide sequence variants lead to the same amino acid sequence (nt:aa ratio) within an individual mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This nt:aa ratio could be indicative of the precursor frequency for an amino acid clonotype within a given mouse. Generation probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>a) and degree of sharedness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) were both strongly associated with the nt:aa ratio (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>c for integrated data analysis). A single clonotype (CASSRTGEQYF) appeared in the form of four different nucleotide sequence variants (nt:aa ratio = 4) in two mice. This clone had one of the highest generation probabilities (1.04<sup>−5</sup>) and a maximum degree of sharedness (12/12). Clonotypes with a nt:aa ratio of 3, 2 or 1 had median generation probabilities and degrees of sharedness in descending respective orders. We finally investigated whether we could also directly observe that heightened nt:aa ratios would result in higher clone fractions. Indeed, median clone fractions rose with increasing nt:aa ratios from 1 to 3. For the two instances in which the clonotype CASSRTGEQYF was observed in the form of four different nucleotide sequence variants, it did not reach a high clone fraction. Overall, these data suggest that increased precursor frequencies, as potentially indicated by heightened nt:aa ratios, are not only a function of increased generation probabilities, but also result in higher degrees of sharedness. On average (as expressed by the median), higher nt:aa ratios result in higher clone fractions, but more and more precise data are needed to conclusively address this.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-pathogens-09-00650"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>We sequenced the TCR repertoire of IE2-OVA-mCMV-specific T cell responses in-depth over time. While we have previously focused our analysis on the successive outgrowth of dominating clones [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], in this work we first investigated how many new unique clones are recruited during the course of the immune response. This revealed that the TCR repertoire stabilizes during memory inflation not only in terms of its evenness, but also in terms of its composition of unique clonotypes. In non-thymectomized animals, stabilization occurred at a little less than 400 unique CDR3β sequences per mouse. This number is likely an underestimate of the absolute number of different clonotypes, since we cannot deduct with how many different CDR3α chains these CDR3β chains are pairing and the analysis from peripheral blood will be subject to sampling bias. These challenges to estimate the absolute number of unique TCRs, many of which are analogous to the “unseen species problem” in ecology, are extensively discussed elsewhere [<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Of note, however, the CD8+ T cell precursor frequency for SIINFEKL has previously been reported to be 50–200 cells [<xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and our own observations suggest this number to be even slightly higher (unpublished data). These numbers should approximate the number of overall observed sequences in the memory repertoire—if recruitment into the immune response is as complete as it has been reported for OT-I cells [<xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]—and therefore render some credence to our obtained numbers of unique TCRs per mouse.</p><p>Independent from these considerations, the observed repertoire stabilization during memory inflation is striking. First, this confirmed that our sequencing methodology was technically clean, as e.g., sorting impurities would have led to capturing random sequences and therefore to a continuous increase in cumulative unique CDR3 sequences. Second, while we most probably missed TCR sequences due to sampling bias at early time points, at least at late time points the sampling bias did not seem to be a confounding factor. Third, from a biological perspective nourishment of the antigen-specific pool during memory inflation did not seem to come from novel thymic emigrants. This is in line with previous reports that inflationary T cells are mainly fed by early-primed memory T cells [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In thymectomized animals the cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences was reduced. The fact that this reduction became apparent only at later time points could be explained by a more dominant sampling bias at early time points, although a role of thymic emigrants contributing to the late immune response cannot be excluded [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Fourth, the saturation of repertoires within individual mice gave us a leverage point to look at saturation across individual mice.</p><p>Such a saturation across individual mice is only possible when clonotypes are public. We confirmed previous reports that many CMV-specific clonotypes occur in more than one individual organism [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, we observed that the number of cumulative unique CDR3 sequences did not rise in a linear manner with increasing cumulative mouse repertoires analyzed, suggesting saturation to occur at some point. We applied a saturation model to our data to more closely investigate this. We observed that the maximum antigen-specific repertoire should be highly diverse, but limited, and predict that half of the maximum of overall TCR sequences should be visible at around 100 cumulative mouse repertoires, with the exact numbers being confounded by the same biases as discussed above. Future studies may therefore be able to more accurately predict the absolute number of unique clonotypes in a mouse by investigating around 100 mice (due to the present biases, this number may vary, but it is unlikely that it will be an underestimate by several orders of magnitude) while overcoming confounding factors by single-cell sequencing and harvesting material from blood and all lymphoid organs.</p><p>We observed that public clonotypes constituted the majority of expanded clones despite accounting only for a minority of unique CDR3 sequences, which is in line with previous reports investigating this aspect for IE3- and M38-specific T cell responses at late time points of infection [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Beyond mere classification into private vs. public, the degree of sharedness can be highly heterogenous. Few studies have so far investigated the degree of sharedness in a systematic manner [<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] despite its importance for contextualization of public sequences in respect to their generation probabilities [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We observed a considerable number of clonotypes in up to 10/12 mice for CDR3α and 12/12 mice for CDR3β. These “supra-public” clonotypes often dominated the antigen-specific response, which is completely disproportionate given their rarity (meaning how few of all unique CDR3 sequences they represent). Overall, the mean degree of sharedness of the antigen-specific repertoire was in-between 5–7 out of 12 mice, with no major shifts over time. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform a systematic and in-depth investigation these aspects for CMV, but also any kind of antigen-specific immune response.</p><p>The occurrence of public TCR sequences is tightly associated with TCR generation probability [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We applied OLGA [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for accurate estimation of generation probability to our unique data set of TCRs covering a wide range of degrees of sharedness and defined time points after infection. Generation probability markedly influenced the likelihood for a TCR to be public (with a threshold of at least 10<sup>−17</sup>), but did not further predict the degree of sharedness. The latter stands in contrast to previous reported work, which however only investigated TCR sequences in bulk (and did not focus on certain antigen-specificities) and thereby also analyzed a much larger number of sequences [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesize that, apart from sampling bias, TCR affinity could be a relevant confounding factor in this regard [<xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Overall, dominating clones at the acute phase of the immune response and during memory inflation showed high degrees of sharedness as well as high generation probabilities and we could show that the combination of both parameters can serve as an enrichment filter for identifying clones that will contribute significantly to the antigen-specific T cell response (arguably representing highly functional TCRs). This may prove useful for in silico prediction of TCRs with clinical potential in the context of adoptive cell therapy.</p><p>It has been argued that the TCR recombination machinery may have evolved in a manner that highly functional TCRs are inherently more probable to be generated [<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As intriguing as this thought is, such evolutionary aspects are hard to investigate experimentally. Instead, we hypothesize that heightened intraindividual precursor frequencies may explain why TCRs with high generation probability expand more robustly. To this end, we used the intraindividual number of nucleotide sequence variants that give rise to one common TCR amino acid sequence (nt:aa ratio) as a proxy indicator of precursor frequencies within a given mouse. Both generation probability and degree of sharedness were tightly associated with the nt:aa ratio. Since theoretical nt:aa ratio possibilities for a given sequences are an inherent part of generation probability calculation, this is not surprising, but validates the calculation and confirms the tight association with the degree of sharedness. On average (as expressed by the median), an elevated nt:aa ratio also indicated a higher clone fraction, although more data are needed to corroborate this point. A high clone fraction in clones with a nt:aa ratio of 1 does not exclude the possibility of an increased precursor frequency since, naturally, high generation probabilities can also lead to the exact same nucleotide sequence being generated within one organism repetitively. We have previously shown how much the robustness of a clonal response depends on the number of precursors [<xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The exact copy number abundance of individual clonotypes that is present in a naïve antigen-specific repertoire therefore represents a highly relevant point for future investigation.</p><p>Overall, here we show that generation probability is a major determinant of the T cell response to SIINFEKL-expressing CMV. The results are consistent with so far described T cell responses against other natural CMV epitopes [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], arguing against a special intrinsic feature of SIINFEKL to induce (supra-)public T cell responses. Instead, the fact that similarly public responses are observed towards natural CMV epitopes points into the direction that the public nature of the T cell response could be due to the mode of antigen presentation rather than the epitope itself. This is in line with reports describing that it is rather the context of gene expression that defines the immunodominance hierarchy of CMV antigens [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In future studies, it will be important to investigate both T cell responses against the same epitope under different expression modes as well as against different epitopes (ideally expressed in the same mode) to shed further light on these issues. Since many different model systems exist for SIINFEKL, our work provides a resource to compare the T cell responses to the same epitope under different expression systems (e.g., by using <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> OVA or OVA-expressing tumor model systems). Such comparisons will be particularly informative since CMV vectors are being investigated for vaccine delivery, and CMV epitope presentation seems to induce unconventional immunogenicity patterns [<xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our choice to study the T cell response against a model antigen in a highly controlled experimental system was therefore deliberate. It should be noted, however, that translation of our findings to the human setting will also be complicated by the fact that human beings are highly diverse in their HLA status (which has a major effect on the immunodominance of individual epitopes) and can be re-infected by different CMV strains.</p><p>While we have previously reported TCR affinity to be a significant modulator of T cell fate during CMV infection [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we did not observe such dramatic changes with regards to the mean generation probability over time (during the course of the immune response, e.g., when comparing the peak of the acute response to time points during memory inflation). Rather, it appears that generation probability affects the likelihood to significantly expand within the T cell response at any time point during infection. We therefore hypothesize that most of the presented results are transferrable to other infection and perhaps even non-infectious disease settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.

Clonotypes were defined as chains with identical CDR3 amino acid sequences. Receptor counts were summed for sequences with differing CDR3 nucleotide sequences, provided they shared CDR3 amino acid identity. Samples with exceptionally low read counts (&lt;45,000 reads) were excluded from analysis. Receptors were further filtered if one of the following criteria was met: (1) Average PHRED quality score was below 20; (2) CDR3 sequence contained a stop codon; (3) CDR3 was shorter than 6 amino acids long.</p><p>All data grouping, merging and processing was performed with Python 3, using the Pandas library.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.3. Generation Probability</title><p>Calculation of the generation probability was based on the CDR3 amino acid sequence. For this, OLGA [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was used. The generation probability was calculated for TRB (CDR3β) sequences. The generation probability was not calculated for TRA (CDR3α) due to the lack of availability of model parameters. Sequences with a generation probability of 0 were excluded from analysis unless otherwise indicated.</p><p>For the saturation analysis, the clones belonging to the same mouse were pooled. Next, a random ordering of mice (e.g., [mouse_{1}, mouse_{5}, … mouse_{2}]), was iterated. At each step of the iteration, the set of clones found in a mouse was merged with the set of all previously observed clones. The result was a set of data points mapping the number of mice (=iteration number) to the number of unique clones observed. 100 such random orderings were made, and the resulting data points were then fitted using a saturation model. For this, the following equation was used:<disp-formula>Y = Bmax × X/(Kd + X)</disp-formula>
in which Y is the cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences and X is the number of cumulative mouse repertoires. Bmax then indicates the saturated number of unique CDR3 sequences if an infinite number of mice was studied, and Kd indicates the number of mice that is needed to observe 50% of Bmax. Fitting was performed with Prism GraphPad (Version 8.1.2).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.4.

Mice with truncating <italic>Apc</italic> germline mutations have been used as a standard model of CRC, but most of the <italic>Apc</italic>-mutated lines develop multiple tumors in the proximal small intestine and rarely in the colon precluding detailed analysis of colon tumor microenvironment. Our aim was to develop a model with higher resemblance to human CRC and to characterize tumor infiltrating immune cells in spontaneously developing colon tumors compared to small intestinal tumors. Therefore, the <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> line was treated repeatedly with azoxymethane (AOM) and 90% colon tumor incidence and 4 to 5 colon tumors per mouse were achieved. Of note, AOM treatment specifically increased the tumor burden in the colon, but not in the small intestine. Histological grading and WNT-signaling activity did not differ significantly between small intestinal and colon tumors with some lesions progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma in both locations. However, characterization of the intratumoral myeloid cell compartment revealed a massive infiltration of colon tumors with neutrophils − 6-fold higher than in small intestinal tumors. Moreover, CCL17-expressing macrophages and dendritic cells accumulated in the tumors indicating the establishment of a tumor-promoting immunosuppressive environment. Thus, <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice treated with AOM are a suitable and straightforward model to study the influence of immune cells and chemokines on colon carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>adenomatous polyposis coli</kwd><kwd>azoxymethane</kwd><kwd>tumor immunology and microenvironment</kwd><kwd>tumor-associated neutrophils</kwd><kwd>tumor-associated macrophages</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">KR2199/3-2</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">KR2199/6-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">KR2199/9-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">SFB1054/TPA06</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">SFB1371/P10</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004350</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4" /><table-count count="0" /><equation-count count="0" /><ref-count count="56" /><page-count count="12" /><word-count count="7263" /></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, especially in countries with “Western” life style. Aberrant WNT signaling plays an important role in initiation of human colorectal carcinogenesis. Loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (<italic>APC</italic>) tumor suppressor is not only the cause of familial adenomatous polyposis, but also 80–90% of sporadic CRC harbor loss of function mutations—mostly truncating nonsense mutations—in the <italic>APC</italic> gene (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The second <italic>APC</italic> allele is inactivated by promoter methylation, chromosomal loss, or additional mutations leading to biallelic loss (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) or inactivation of <italic>APC</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As a result, β-catenin is not degraded, accumulates and translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator inducing the expression of WNT target genes including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and osteopontin which promote proliferation and ultimately tumor formation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Additional mutations, e.g., in <italic>KRAS, PTEN, PIK3CA, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD2, SMAD4</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic> are found in <italic>APC</italic>-mutated sporadic CRC, which promote tumor progression. In contrast, CRC lacking <italic>APC</italic> mutations are frequently associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Mice heterozygous for truncating germline mutations of <italic>Apc</italic>, such as the <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> line on C57BL/6 background (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) have been used for decades as a preclinical model. A major disadvantage of the frequently used <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> model is however that the mice quickly develop multiple adenomas in the small intestine (SI), and only few polyps in the colon, which leads to a life span of &lt;6 months on the C57BL/6 background (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Further, progression of these lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma is very rare (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice were generated by inserting a neomycin cassette in antisense orientation into exon 15, resulting in chain termination at codon 1638 and production of an unstable protein. These mice develop intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinomas, which was attributed to somatic loss of the wildtype <italic>Apc</italic> allele (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) or rather <italic>Apc</italic> mutations as described in a more recent publication (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In comparison to <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice the <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice develop less tumors with longer latency and show progression to invasive adenocarcinomas, as well as splenomegaly and desmoid formation, thus more closely resembling human CRC. Although colon tumors develop in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice, their incidence and number is low and their formation takes 10–12 months (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Treating <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice with “Western style” diet (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) or crossing them with other genetically engineered mutant or knockout mice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) promotes multiplicity and sometimes progression of tumors in SI and/or colon. Similarly, conditional knockout of <italic>Apc</italic> in colonic epithelial cells leads to selective colon tumor formation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>However, mice carrying several mutant or transgenic alleles are cumbersome to work with for mechanistic studies, which require crossing these models with additional knockout or transgenic mice. Moreover, when using a Cre-mediated knockout of <italic>Apc</italic> in colonic epithelial cells for tumor formation, alternative recombinase systems need to be used for conditional gene knockouts in other cell types.</p><p>Induction of colitis by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) greatly accelerates adenoma and adenocarcinoma formation in the colon of <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), but this model is not suitable to study tumorigenesis in the absence of overt inflammation, which would better mimick human CRC pathogenesis. Administration of azoxymethan (AOM), an alkylating agent that produces free radicals, to C57BL/6 mice leads to low incidence tumor formation in the colon by causing mutations in β-catenin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). AOM treatment increased incidence and numbers of colon adenomas and adenocarcinomas in adult <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and in young or neonatal <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice, but these mice still had a predominance of small intestinal tumors and a short life span (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The histological features of tumors from these mice have been described but a detailed characterization e.g., regarding immune cell infiltration is lacking.</p><p>Studies performed in the <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> model indicate that tumors are controlled by the adaptive immune system (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, regulatory T cells and myeloid cells, such as tumor associated neutrophilic granulocytes (TAN) and monocytic cells (functionally described as myeloid derived suppressor cells, MDSC) as well as tumor associated macrophages (TAM) together shape the tumor microenvironment to promote tumor growth and to limit the anti-tumor immune response (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A subpopulation of TAMs isolated from subcutaneous tumor models was shown to secrete CCL17 as a hallmark of M2-like macrophage polarization (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Unfortunately, the low incidence and number of spontaneous colon tumors in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> and <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice precludes a detailed characterization of immune cell infiltrates including TAMs and TANs in spontaneously developing colon tumors. We therefore established an accelerated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> model which is suitable for further investigations of the tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immune responses in spontaneously forming colon tumors. In this study we show that repeated administration of AOM to <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice leads to a higher incidence and an increased number of tumors in the colon and shortens experimental time to 6–7 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Repeated Injection of AOM Leads to Higher Incidence and Multiplicity of Colon Tumors and Decreased Survival in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> Mice</title><p>To generate more colon tumors in a shorter experimental time, adult C57BL/6 mice carrying one CCL17-eGFP knock-in allele as a reporter for CCL17 expression received weekly AOM injections for 6 weeks, and were followed by clinical assessment until anemia was clinically apparent or other criteria for euthanasia were reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Tumors developing in AOM treated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice express WNT target genes and show aberrant accumulation of β-catenin, as expected for WNT driven carcinogenesis. Strikingly, comparison of immune cell infiltrates between colonic and SI tumors revealed a significantly higher frequency of neutrophilic granulocytes in colon tumors. Further, increased expression of CCL17 in DCs and M2-like TAMs within tumors compared to intestinal lamina propria indicates the establishment of a tumor-promoting immunosuppressive environment. Thus, AOM treated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice can be used as a model of early colon carcinogenesis to further investigate the interplay of immune cells, stromal cells, and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Repeated AOM administration has been used previously as a model for sporadic CRC. A sufficient incidence of colon tumors can be achieved by AOM administration in the susceptible A/J strain but not in the C57BL/6 strain (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which is the background of the majority of genetically engineered mouse lines, e.g., for functional studies of relevant immune cell types. Therefore, we sought to combine <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mutant mice with AOM treatment and observed greatly increased incidence and multiplicity of colon tumors, demonstrating a synergistic effect of the truncating <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mutation and AOM-induced mutations, which led to increased cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and upregulation of canonical WNT target genes.</p><p>Besides the slightly reduced number of small intestinal tumors, their size was reduced and the majority showed low grade IEN in AOM treated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice. This is probably due to the earlier termination of the experiment and demonstrates that AOM is specifically affecting the colon. Histologically, high grade IENs and invasive adenocarcinomas were found with comparable frequency in 5–7 months old AOM treated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice as in 10–12 months old untreated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice. Thus, AOM treatment accelerated tumor progression, but did not lead to deeper tissue invasion beyond the bowel wall or to metastasis. An increased incidence and number of colon tumors was also reported in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice after repeated AOM treatment (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice have a much higher spontaneous tumor burden in the small intestine, and therefore a shorter life time that precludes further progression of lesions along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The AOM treated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice in the present study provide the opportunity to assess the influence of additional risk factors and immune responses on both, lesion incidence and progression to invasive carcinoma. It was shown in a recent study that administration of AOM alone or combined with <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection increased proliferation and Dclk1-positive cancer stem cell frequency in intestinal tumors of <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice indicating enhanced tumorigenesis in line with our results (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, the impact of AOM administration on tumor multiplicity and progression was not reported in this publication.</p><p>Comparison of small intestinal and colon tumors revealed that neutrophilic granulocytes marked by CD11b and Ly6G expression are massively recruited and dominate the myeloid cell infiltrate in colon tumors but not small intestinal tumors. This shows that location has a great impact on the composition of immune cell infiltrates in intestinal tumors, but the regulation of this preferential accumulation of neutrophilic cells in colon tumors is not known. Intratumoral CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6-G<sup>high</sup> cells consist of classical neutrophils (TANs) and/or pathologically activated immunosuppressive PMN-MDSC, which accumulate in the tumors, but are also found in blood, spleen and bone marrow of tumor bearing mice. TANs are heterogeneous and can have anti-tumor or protumor activity. Their prognostic role in CRC is controversial (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Although it was shown recently that neutrophils can limit tumor progression in the very early phase of murine CRC models by restricting tumor-associated bacteria and inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), the majority of reports provide evidence for a tumor supporting role of TANs. PMN-MDSC, which develop at later stages, are by definition immunosuppressive and promote tumor initiation, progression and dissemination (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Accumulation of neutrophils/PMN-MDSCs in small intestinal and colon tumors of <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice correlated with increased expression of CCL2 compared to normal intestinal tissue with slightly higher expression in colon tumors. Chun et al. also reported increased CCL2 expression in colitis associated colon cancer, sporadic CRC as well as precancerous colorectal lesions in humans and in mouse models (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In these models CCL2 was shown to be required for PMN-MDSC and M-MDSC accumulation in the tumors and enhanced the T cell suppressive function of PMN-MDSC (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In addition to CCL2, CXCR2 ligands including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL8 produced by CRC cells and neutrophils themselves were found to be responsible for recruitment of CXCR2<sup>+</sup> neutrophils/PMN-MDSCs to colon tumors (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). We have shown earlier that specific colon microbiota in human patients are correlated with chemokine production and infiltration of immune cell subsets (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Preferential recruitment of neutrophilic cells to colon tumors vs. small intestinal tumors could therefore involve site-specific microbiota signals and inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), but also genetic mechanisms of tumor initiation, which differ between tumor locations in the intestine (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Further investigation of tumor infiltrating myeloid cells in intestinal tumors of AOM-treated and untreated <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice confirmed the presence of all subpopulations of monocytes, macrophages and DCs with comparable frequencies in small intestinal and colon tumors. PD-L1 was expressed on tumor-infiltrating monocytic cells, albeit at lower levels than in colon lamina propria. But macrophages, granulocytes and DCs showed only low level expression mimicking the situation in human CRC, where low PD-L1 expression correlates with poor response to PD-1 blockade (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Successful therapy with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) is restricted to the subgroup of mismatch repair deficient CRC which show higher PD-L1 expression (mainly in tumor-associated immune cells) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Thus, our model is suitable for investigating regulation of PD-L1 expression in colon tumors and testing therapeutic approaches, which aim to increase responsiveness to checkpoint inhibition.</p><p>Using <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> CCL17-eGFP reporter mice, we found that TAMs and DCs upregulate expression of CCL17 in the microenvironment of small intestinal and colon tumors developing in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>1638N/+</sup> mice. CCL17 expression has been used as a marker for M2-like immunosuppressive TAMs and was shown to correlate with Treg frequencies in tumors in line with its ability to attract Tregs expressing CCR4 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs (such as CSF-1R inhibitors) were shown to be effective in syngeneic subcutaneous tumor models, but only in combination with immune stimulation or checkpoint blockade (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Further studies are required to identify novel target molecules, which prevent or revert the immunosuppressive and tumor promoting functions of TAMs and other tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell subpopulations in spontaneously developing cancers, such as the CRC model described here.</p><p>The model described here also allows assessing the phenotype of diverse complete and conditional knockout mouse strains with a simple breeding strategy since only one mutated <italic>Apc</italic> allele is necessary, whereas Cre recombinase or complex husbandry regimes are not required for colon tumor formation.

One cardinal feature in severe type 2-dominated airway inflammation is the release of lipid mediators of the eicosanoid family that can either promote or dampen allergic inflammation. Macrophages are key producers of prostaglandins and leukotrienes which play diverse roles in allergic airway inflammation and thus require tight control. Using RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), enzyme immunoassays (EIA), gene expression analysis and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to this control <italic>via</italic> transcriptional regulation of lipid mediator synthesis enzymes in bone marrow-derived as well as in primary alveolar macrophages. In the absence or inhibition of AhR activity, multiple genes of both the prostaglandin and the leukotriene pathway were downregulated, resulting in lower synthesis of prostanoids, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and cysteinyl leukotrienes, e.g., Leukotriene C4 (LTC<sub>4</sub>). These AhR-dependent genes include <italic>PTGS1</italic> encoding for the enzyme cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and <italic>ALOX5</italic> encoding for the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) both of which major upstream regulators of the prostanoid and leukotriene pathway, respectively. This regulation is independent of the activation stimulus and partially also detectable in unstimulated macrophages suggesting an important role of basal AhR activity for eicosanoid production in steady state macrophages. Lastly, we demonstrate that AhR deficiency in hematopoietic but not epithelial cells aggravates house dust mite induced allergic airway inflammation. These results suggest an essential role for AhR-dependent eicosanoid regulation in macrophages during homeostasis and inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>aryl hydrocarbon receptor</kwd><kwd>eicosanoids</kwd><kwd>leukotriene</kwd><kwd>prostaglandin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council

Treatment options are limited and include anti-histaminic drugs, general immune suppression by corticosteroids or targeting of type-2 cytokines by monoclonal antibodies. Eicosanoids are bioactive metabolites derived from the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid that play important pro- but also anti-inflammatory roles in severe type-2 inflammation including allergic asthma (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Current therapies targeting eicosanoid pathways have failed to provide a major advance in the therapy of asthma, owing to a limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control these complex mediators. Arachidonic acid can be metabolized to generate bioactive eicosanoids <italic>via</italic> two distinct pathways: prostanoids are formed <italic>via</italic> the activity of two isozymes (cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), encoded by <italic>PTGS1</italic> and <italic>PTGS2</italic>, respectively) ultimately resulting in the generation of thromboxane and prostaglandins (PGs) including prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>). Importantly, COX1 is expressed constitutively in many cell types, while COX2 expression can be induced by different stimuli including allergens (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Both enzymes catalyze the formation of prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> (PGH<sub>2</sub>) which can then be further metabolized by specific enzymes to PGE<sub>2</sub>, prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>), prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> (PGF<sub>2α</sub>), PGI<sub>2</sub> and thromboxanes A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) and B<sub>2</sub> (TXB<sub>2</sub>), collectively known as prostanoids. Alternatively, the activity of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO, encoded by <italic>ALOX5)</italic> catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes (LTs) such as the pro-inflammatory leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>), C<sub>4</sub> (LTC<sub>4</sub>) and D<sub>4</sub> (LTD<sub>4</sub>). While LTs and PGD<sub>2</sub> are important drivers of type-2 inflammation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGI<sub>2</sub> have anti-inflammatory functions and can dampen allergic inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Thus, the eicosanoid system represents an important layer of immune regulation in type 2 immunity dominated disorders (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Myeloid cell types such as macrophages represent a major cell type involved in the generation of bioactive LTs and prostanoids (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In recent years, macrophages were shown to constitute a highly plastic and heterogenous cell population that can adapt to various microenvironments by adopting metabolically and functionally different cellular states. Specifically, type-2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 but also other environmental factors trigger the expression of enzymes to foster LT and prostanoid biosynthesis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, there is currently a lack of understanding which transcription factors are enabling and regulating eicosanoid synthesis and function in macrophages.</p><p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand activated transcription factor that is present in the cytosol and upon binding to its ligands can translocate to the nucleus and induce gene transcription. AhR ligands include aromatic hydrocarbons mostly derived from external sources but also endogenous ligands of the tryptophan catabolism such as indole derivatives (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Depending on structural differences, AhR ligands may act as agonists or competitive antagonists probably contributing to the diverse AhR functions ranging from detoxification, maintaining stemness to cellular differentiation processes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We have previously demonstrated an important role for AhR in the regulation of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in a murine house dust mite (HDM) model (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, which pathways are dysregulated in the absence of AhR remains unclear. Based on previous reports suggesting a role for AhR in the regulation of eicosanoids in an epithelial cell line (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), we investigated in this study whether the AhR contributes to the regulation of eicosanoids in alveolar macrophages.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that AhR serves as a transcriptional regulator for a set of genes in alveolar or alveolar-like macrophages (COX-1, 5-LO and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), encoded by (<italic>PTGS1</italic>, <italic>ALOX5</italic> and <italic>LTC4S</italic>)). Moreover, production of eicosanoids including all cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTE<sub>4</sub>, and PGE<sub>2</sub> was impaired in AhR insensitive macrophages induced by either chemical inhibition or genetic AhR deficiency. This defect in eicosanoid production was readily detectable at steady state and maintained across a set of different stimuli suggesting a central role for the AhR in the regulation of basic eicosanoid biosynthesis capacity of macrophages. Lastly, mice with hematopoietic- but not epithelial-specific AhR deficiency showed a more severe inflammation in an HDM model of allergic airway inflammation including cellular infiltration to the bronchoalveolar fluid. Altogether, our results suggest a central role for the AhR in alveolar macrophages’ ability to metabolize arachidonic acid into functionally active LTs and PGs which might be instrumental to prevent exaggerated type 2 inflammation in the lung.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57/B6/J wildtype (WT), AhR<sup>KO/KO</sup> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) (B6.129-<italic>Ahr<sup>tm1Bra</sup>

We have previously shown that the absence of AhR triggers an aggravated inflammatory response in both pollen and HDM-induced AAI (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In order to investigate whether alveolar-like macrophages might be compromised in their lipid mediator synthesis capacity, we differentiated BMDMs from wildtype and AhR-deficient animals in the presence of TGF-β to mimic alveolar-like macrophages (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and stimulated them with the TLR4 ligand LPS. Bulk RNA sequencing of unstimulated- and LPS-stimulated BMDMs revealed major differences in gene expression profiles according to genotype (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1A</bold>
</xref>). Among other genes, AhR-deficient BMDMs showed reduced expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic>, <italic>PTGS1</italic> and <italic>LTC4S</italic> among the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AhR-deficient and control BMDMs after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1A</bold>

<bold>Figure 1B</bold>
</xref>). Besides external sources, tryptophan metabolism is known as the primary cell-intrinsic pathway to generate AhR ligands (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Together, these data suggest that AhR activity may regulate lipid mediator synthesis in alveolar-like macrophages.</p><p>In parallel to RNA sequencing, we performed ATAC sequencing to investigate the chromatin accessibility and determined differential accessible regions (DARs). We then systematically compared gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same samples (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1C</bold>
</xref>). 149 and 277 genes with increased expression (DEGup in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1C</bold>
</xref>) were associated to regions with increased chromatin accessibility (DARup) in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated AhR-deficient BMDMs, respectively. By contrast, 339 and 610 genes with decreased expression (DEGdown) were associated to regions with decreased chromatin accessibility (DARdown) in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated AhR-deficient BMDMs, respectively. Many more genes showed either selective regions with differential chromatin accessibility or gene expression profiles according to genotype. We therefore focused on a cluster of curated eicosanoid relevant genes (ERGs) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1E</bold>
</xref>). Indeed, a cluster of these genes was significantly downregulated in AhR-deficient BMDMs (<italic>ALOX5</italic>, <italic>LTC4S</italic>, <italic>HPGDS</italic>, <italic>PTGS1</italic>) irrespective of whether BMDMs have been stimulated or not while few genes showed a stronger expression in AhR-deficient BMDMs upon LPS stimulation (<italic>PTGIS</italic>, <italic>ALOX12</italic>, <italic>PTGS2</italic>) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

Interestingly, elevated induction of COX-2 expression (encoded by <italic>PTGS2</italic>) has already been observed in an AhR-deficient cell line of alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We then searched for ERGs that showed differential expression and an association to differential chromatin accessibility and identified the enzymes 5-LO (<italic>ALOX5</italic>) and COX-1 (<italic>PTGS1</italic>) as two of the few genes fitting to this definition (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1E</bold>
</xref>). Overall, the mean normalized ATAC-seq coverage of downregulated DARs associated to differentially expressed ERGs (the intersection in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1E</bold>
</xref>) revealed a two- to threefold reduction in AhR-deficient BMDMs (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1F</bold>

</xref>). Importantly, one DAR associated to the <italic>PTGS1</italic> gene contained two AhR/Arnt motifs (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

Thus, the AhR transcription factor regulates a number of genes involved in lipid mediator synthesis in part by regulating by chromatin accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>AhR-deficient macrophages have an altered lipid mediator profile</title><p>Next, we wanted to confirm the expression patterns of enzymes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis in AhR-sufficient and AhR-deficient BMDMs. Indeed, AhR-deficient BMDMs showed consistently reduced expression of the microsomal prostaglandin E Synthase-1 mPGES-1 (<italic>PTGES</italic>), COX-1 (<italic>PTGS1</italic>), 5-LO (<italic>ALOX5</italic>) and LTC4S (<italic>LTC4S</italic>) even in unstimulated cells compared to WT BMDMs (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

As expected, BMDM stimulation with LPS or HDM affected the expression of the aforementioned genes, but the AhR-dependent differences in gene expression were overall maintained (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

In order to test the functional consequences for eicosanoid production, we profiled these samples for a panel of 15 lipid mediators by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after short term stimulation with ionophore to trigger maximal release of eicosanoids. Indeed, we found reduced amounts of prostanoids (PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub> and TBX<sub>2</sub>) and leukotrienes (LTB<sub>4</sub>, LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTE<sub>4</sub>) which was again obvious in unstimulated and LPS stimulated BMDMs (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

Therefore, we crossed LysM<sup>Cre</sup> and Vav<sup>Cre</sup> mice with animals harboring floxed alleles of exon 2 of the AhR gene to ablate AhR expression in either LysM-expressing macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils (LysM<sup>Cre</sup>) or all hematopoietic cells (Vav<sup>Cre</sup>), respectively, and subjected these animals to an established HDM model to elicit allergic airway inflammation (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">

</xref>). Altogether, these results strongly argue for an important function of AhR activity in alveolar macrophages for the regulation of HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation. The AhR-dependent transcriptional regulation of prostanoid and cysLT synthesis likely plays an important role in governing allergic inflammation of the airways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we investigated whether the transcription factor AhR affects arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator biosynthesis in macrophages as a possible explanation for enhanced susceptibility of AhR-deficient animals to allergic airway inflammation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Our results demonstrate that AhR-deficient alveolar and bone marrow-derived alveolar-like macrophages showed a systematically reduced production of prostanoids and cysLTs across a range of different stimuli including allergens. This AhR-dependent regulation of eicosanoid synthesis was even detectable in resting macrophages and could be confirmed in WT macrophages treated with an AhR antagonist, excluding the possibility that a reduced capacity to synthesize eicosanoids is a side effect of gene targeting in AhR-deficient macrophages. More generally, bulk RNA and ATAC sequencing of alveolar-like macrophages revealed that AhR regulates a set of genes involved in rate-limiting steps of eicosanoid biosynthesis. For instance, AhR-deficient macrophages showed reduced expression of <italic>LTC4S</italic> and <italic>ALOX5</italic>. 5-LO, the product of <italic>ALOX5</italic>, regulates the formation of LTA<sub>4</sub> which is further metabolized <italic>via</italic> the activity of LTC4S to LTC<sub>4</sub> and subsequently to LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTE<sub>4</sub>. The formation of LTB<sub>4</sub> does not depend directly on LTC4S activity but is dependent on LTA<sub>4</sub> levels. Our data clearly suggest that AhR is a transcriptional regulator for 5-LO and LTC4S resulting in a reduced capability of AhR-deficient macrophages to generate cysLTs. Within the prostanoid pathway, we initially focused on a possible transcriptional regulation of mPGES-1 as the rate-limiting enzyme for the generation of anti-inflammatory PGE<sub>2</sub> in type 2 immunity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) because reduced levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> may contribute to an increased allergic airway inflammation in the absence of AhR activity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> is synthesized from PGH<sub>2</sub>
<italic>via</italic> mPGES-1 activity but, surprisingly, also PGD<sub>2</sub> levels were reduced in AhR-deficient BMDMs (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures 2D, E</bold>
</xref>). This prompted us to investigate also the expression of the more upstream COX enzymes. Noteworthy, both bulk sequencing and quantitative analysis revealed marked reduction of COX1 expression (encoded by <italic>PTGS1</italic>). Both COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes can convert AA into PGH<sub>2</sub> but only COX2 expression is typically upregulated during inflammation while COX1 is thought to be expressed in a more constitutive manner and fulfils basic physiological functions in both immune and non-immune cell types (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). A reduced expression of COX-1 may thus suggest that the basic capacity of AhR-deficient macrophages to generate prostanoids is compromised. In contrast to COX-1, COX-2 expression could be upregulated more strongly in AhR-deficient BMDMs (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures 1A, D</bold>
</xref>), a phenomenon that has also been observed in an AhR-deficient alveolar type II cell line (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Yet, this compensatory upregulation of COX-2 was not sufficient to overcome reduced COX-1 activity and the physiological generation of prostanoids.</p><p>AhR deficiency may also compromise the differentiation of myeloid cells including alveolar-like macrophages that may have an important long-term effect on airway pathogenesis. Indeed, AhR activity has been linked to the differentiation of monocytes towards the dendritic cell versus the macrophage lineage (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and the basic capability for eicosanoid biosynthesis differs between both cell types (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, as AhR inhibitor treatment of WT cells after BMDM differentiation was equally able to reduce the expression of COX-1 (<italic>PTGS1</italic>) and 5-LO (<italic>ALOX5</italic>) and partially also reduce LCT4S and mPGES-1 expression, we propose that AhR activity regulates the expression of these enzymes independently of potential AhR effects on myeloid differentiation. During allergic responses, the reduced COX-1-driven regulation by anti-inflammatory prostanoids such as PGE<sub>2</sub> in the absence of AhR activity cannot compensate the reduced synthesis of pro-inflammatory cysLTs which would normally be expected to result in reduced inflammation. Instead, as both rate-limiting enzymes of the prostanoid and leukotriene pathway (5-LO and COX-1) are compromised in the absence of AhR activity, AhR signaling in macrophages may be required to engage the full potential of alveolar macrophages for the generation of eicosanoids. In the absence of this potential, the regulatory role of eicosanoids is vanished and associated with an enhanced risk for uncontrolled allergic sensitization and inflammation. Importantly, the AhR has been previously shown to act as a break for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation of macrophages with LPS (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). However, this hypersensitivity and the aggravated inflammation observed <italic>in vivo</italic> often prevents to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms in a single cell type given the manifold roles the AhR can play in different immune cells.</p><p>Along this hypothesis, we found that hematopoietic but not epithelial AhR deficiency recapitulated exaggerated inflammation in the HDM model (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>
</xref>) which we have observed previously in complete AhR deficient animals (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). One limitation of our study is the possible contribution of other hematopoietic cell types to the exaggerated inflammation such as dendritic cells or granulocytes. In this regard, the LysM<sup>Cre</sup> mouse line may not be a suitable Cre-expressing line to ablate AhR gene expression with high efficiency in alveolar macrophages. Additionally, minimal AhR expression may be sufficient for AhR-dependent regulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis relevant genes while targeting other genes using the LysM<sup>Cre</sup> line may show a stronger dose-dependence in alveolar macrophages.</p><p>Unfortunately, the profiling of eicosanoids in bronchoalveolar fluids of HDM-treated animals by LC-MS/MS was not successful as eicosanoid levels in many samples were below the lower limit of detection (not shown). However, macrophages are thought to constitute one of the major eicosanoid-producing cell type and in contrast to intestinal eosinophils, pulmonary eosinophils have so far not been shown to be regulated by AhR activity (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>Whether AhR ligands are able to foster the generation of either prostanoid or cysLT production in a ligand-specific manner and may thus represent a suitable therapeutic strategy will be part of future investigations. As environmental pollutants often contain AhR ligands acting either as agonists or antagonists (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), AhR-dependent regulation of bioactive lipid mediators may also provide a novel basis to explore AhR pollutants in epidemiological studies. Indeed, systemic activation by the potent AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) revealed an alteration in arachidonic acid metabolism and eicosanoid biosynthesis including different expression levels of 5-LO and LTC4S and an increase of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes in the liver (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Whether these observations are related to AhR-dependent gene regulation in Kupfer cells or hepatocytes remains to be determined in future studies. Noteworthy, the AhR immediate target enzymes of the cytochrome P450 CYP1 family may also regulate bioavailability of eicosanoids because these enzymes are able to oxidize and degrade lipid mediators (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Noteworthy, we did not supply any specific AhR ligand to our cultures suggesting that the AhR-eicosanoid axis is active without external AhR ligands and fueled by cell-intrinsic ligands.</p><p>Eicosanoids play a fundamental role in a variety of physiological processes and diseases beyond allergic diseases. With regard to possible translation of these findings for humans, it is therefore necessary to investigate whether first, human macrophages exhibit a similar AhR dependency for eicosanoid biosynthesis and second, whether this axis is disturbed in patients with type 2 immune disorders, such as allergic asthma and related diseases. Whether impaired AhR activity and associated reduced generation of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators or conversely, excessive AhR activity and associated excessive release of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators contribute to disease pathogenesis remains an interesting study goal and may be one avenue to link the environmental sensor AhR to dysregulated type 2 immune responses at barrier organs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

To date, the OMM<sup>12</sup> model has been established in several germ-free mouse facilities world-wide and is employed to address a growing variety of research questions related to infection biology, mucosal immunology, microbial ecology and host-microbiome metabolic cross-talk. The OMM<sup>12</sup> consists of 12 sequenced and publically available strains isolated from mice, representing five bacterial phyla that are naturally abundant in the murine gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lagkouvardos et al., 2016</xref>). Under germ-free conditions, the OMM<sup>12</sup> colonizes mice stably over multiple generations. Here, we investigated whether stably colonized OMM<sup>12</sup> mouse lines could be reproducibly established in different animal facilities. Germ-free C57Bl/6J mice were inoculated with a frozen mixture of the OMM<sup>12</sup> strains. Within 2 weeks after application, the OMM<sup>12</sup> community reached the same stable composition in all facilities, as determined by fecal microbiome analysis. We show that a second application of the OMM<sup>12</sup> strains after 72 h leads to a more stable community composition than a single application. The availability of such protocols for reliable <italic>de novo</italic> generation of gnotobiotic rodents will certainly contribute to increasing experimental reproducibility in biomedical research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>syncom</kwd><kwd>Oligo-MM12</kwd><kwd>sDMDMm2</kwd><kwd>minimal microbiome</kwd><kwd>3R</kwd><kwd>gnotobiology</kwd><kwd>defined bacterial consortia</kwd><kwd>isobiotic mice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100009139</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7" /><table-count count="2" /><equation-count count="0" /><ref-count count="57" /><page-count count="15" /><word-count count="0" /></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian gut is a complex ecosystem, hosting a diverse microbial community that influences normal physiology and disease susceptibility (mainly) through its metabolic activities. The gut microbiome is highly dynamic throughout life and can vary substantially between individuals due to diet, lifestyle and genetic factors (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ursell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Falony et al., 2016</xref>). Microbiome community profiling and metagenome-based approaches have recently elucidated how inter-individual microbiome differences correlate with disease states and health (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hadrich, 2018</xref>). However, causal relationships between the microbiota and disease conditions can rarely be deciphered with these methods. Ethical and regulatory issues further limit the possibilities of human intervention studies and robust experimental animal models are urgently needed to research the causality between the gut microbiota and various human diseases.</p><p>The laboratory mouse is currently the primary experimental model organism in biomedical research (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). The availability of numerous genetically engineered and mutant mouse strains greatly facilitates functional studies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Eppig et al., 2015</xref>). Mice raised in different research institutions, obtained from different vendors or the wild can exhibit profound differences in microbiota composition (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Stecher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rausch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Sadler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Thiemann et al., 2017</xref>), mimicking the inter-personal microbiota variation in human populations. Apart from vendor-specific microbiomes, genotype and environmental conditions such as diet, cage-type, temperature and bedding can profoundly influence microbiota composition and function (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hildebrand et al., 2013</xref>). These microbiome differences between genetically identical mouse models have led to the serendipitous discovery of numerous microbiota-dependent disease phenotypes in the past, including immune-cell priming, colitis susceptibility and resistance to infections (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Surana and Kasper, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Velazquez et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, there is growing evidence that the microbiota is a major confounding factor, which complicates cross-study comparisons and eventually jeopardizes experimental reproducibility (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Franklin and Ericsson, 2017</xref>). To identify the mechanisms of host genetics-imposed control of the microbiome, adequate experimental design is instrumental (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Laukens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mamantopoulos et al., 2018</xref>). In this respect, gnotobiology (greek: gnosis: knowledge; bios: life; logos: study) has gained importance as it allows for optimal control of microbiota within and in between animal facilities. Besides, gnotobiology has become an essential method to mechanistically investigate microbiota functioning and to assess causality in disease-associated alterations of gut microbiota composition (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Trexler and Reynolds, 1957</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Orcutt et al., 1987</xref>). Gnotobiotic mice can be generated by microbial reconstitution of germ-free mice with fecal transplants, single organisms and defined mouse- or human-derived microbial consortia (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Clavel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et al., 2017</xref>). Several recent studies have focused on the isolation of bacteria from humans and mice and the establishment of culture collections (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hugon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lagkouvardos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Forster et al., 2019</xref>). The most important requirement for the assembly of defined bacterial consortia is the availability of well-characterized and genome-sequenced strains – preferably in public culture collections. Further, state of the art methods to trace and quantify each member of a microbial consortium are needed for quality control and functional studies. Finally, experimental protocols should be optimized to ensure reproducible colonization of germ-free mice with a given microbial consortium.</p><p>A majority of studies uses human-derived bacteria to colonize gnotobiotic mice even though phylogenetic differences between human and mouse microbiota (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>) may affect microbe-host interaction and long-term stability of colonization. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a model based on twelve bacteria from the murine gut microbiota (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brugiroux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Garzetti et al., 2017</xref>). This Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (OMM<sup>12</sup>) provides several improvements to other defined consortia, including broad phylogenetic diversity, public availability of the strains from the German Type Culture Collection<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brugiroux et al., 2016</xref>). Most importantly, the OMM<sup>12</sup> exhibits long-term stability in gnotobiotic mice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brugiroux et al., 2016</xref>). Correspondingly, C57BL/6 mice stably colonized with OMM<sup>12</sup> have recently also been designated stable defined moderately diverse microbiota mice (sDMDMm2) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). The Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF), another frequently used model for gnotobiotic research for more than 40 years is also based on murine bacteria (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Wymore Brand et al., 2015</xref>). Compared to ASF-colonized mice, OMM<sup>12</sup> mice show increased resistance to pathogen colonization (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brugiroux et al., 2016</xref>). These characteristics indicate that OMM<sup>12</sup> mice mimic the normal physiology better than ASF mice and are therefore preferable for microbiome intervention studies that investigate microbiome-correlated diseases. Accordingly, several studies have already implemented the OMM<sup>12</sup> as model to systematically probe for a causal role of individual microbes in protection against different pathogens along the lines of Koch’s postulates (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brugiroux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Studer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Herp et al., 2019</xref>). To date, the OMM<sup>12</sup> model is used by over 30 research groups world-wide to address fundamental research questions related to microbial ecology, metabolism, mucosal immunology and infection biology (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Studer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Uchimura et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a feasibility trial and scrutinize colonization of germ-free C57BL/6 mice with the OMM<sup>12</sup> community. We established a protocol using a standardized OMM<sup>12</sup> inoculum and compared community composition when inoculations were performed repeatedly in the same facility or at different facilities. We show that double inoculation leads to efficient introduction of consortium members in different facilities. Notably, we observed subtle differences in the absolute abundance of some of the strains between different experiments. This also translates to differences in community profiles. Whether this induces functional changes to the community and phenotypic differences in the mice should be a matter of future investigation. Still, care should be taken when comparing results obtained with the model at different facilities. Overall, our study shows that generating mice colonized with the OMM<sup>12</sup> synthetic bacterial consortium shows excellent reproducibility between different animal facilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Animal Facilities</title><p>Five European germ-free rodent facilities participated in this study.

Changes in OMM<sup>12</sup> microbial community composition were closely monitored over time in fecal samples for 99 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this experiment, we used two germ-free breeders from a heterozygous C57BL/6J <italic>Agr2</italic><sup>±</sup> breeding, which were reconstituted with the OMM<sup>12</sup> consortium to generate an isobiotic mouse line (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Herp et al., 2019</xref>). Fecal community composition, represented as relative abundance profiles quantified by strain-specific qPCR, rapidly changed within the first week after OMM<sup>12</sup> inoculation. Beyond day 7 post inoculation, OMM<sup>12</sup> community stabilized and profiles remained highly similar afterward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) of Bray–Curtis dissimilarities showed a gradual shift with time toward a more similar community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Several guidelines were established to optimally control for microbiota differences when using different genetic strains of experimental mice within an animal unit (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Wullaert et al., 2018</xref>). Gnotobiotic mouse models based synthetic microbial consortia are becoming increasingly popular. In particular, these models offer the opportunity to generate “isobiotic” mice, which may significantly enhance experimental reproducibility across different institutions (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</xref>).</p><p>This study reports on the first comparative inter-facility trial conducted to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of a protocol for colonization of germ-free mice with a synthetic bacterial community. The majority of current protocols for introducing synthetic bacterial communities to germ-free mice use mixtures generated from fresh pure bacterial cultures for inoculations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Faith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Desai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gomes-Neto et al., 2017</xref>). These protocols require a sophisticated cultivation setup, including devices for anaerobic bacterial cultivation. Our protocol overcomes these limitations by generating frozen aliquots of a mixture of the strains, which can be distributed, thawed and directly applied. We note that in our trial, frozen aliquots of bacterial mixtures remain viable for at least 18 months at −80°C. Another common method for generating gnotobiotic mice is by co-housing with a colonized donor animal (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Geuking et al., 2011</xref>), a setup which requires no expertise for bacterial cultivation. When using this approach, it should be considered that serial passage of a bacterial community within the same facility or in between facilities, e.g., through breeding, might promote genomic diversification of the individual community members by consecutive rounds of within-host selection (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>). The evolved bacterial community would differentiate genetically and functionally from the parental strains over time. To date, the degree and temporal course of within-host evolution of microbial communities is not known and experimental data are only available for evolution of individual bacterial populations in the gut (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Leatham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">De Paepe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barroso-Batista et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the analysis of individual bacterial populations, it is expected that mutants emerge rapidly and are selected based on improved competitiveness within days. In order to retain genetic identity of a minimal bacterial consortium, it is advisable to regenerate gnotobiotic mouse lines every 18–24 months using original cultures. This period is the result of cost-benefit considerations, keeping the degree of genomic diversification within acceptable boundaries but at the same time, minimizing costs and experimental efforts.</p><p>In this trial, we used aliquots of the same batch of frozen OMM<sup>12</sup> mixed cultures for the inoculations. This allowed us to compare efficiency of inoculation between different facilities using the same starting material. Thereby the inoculum could be eliminated as confounding factor in microbial community establishment in the gut. The gut microbiome of mice can be significantly influenced by husbandry-related factors, such as type of laboratory animal diet (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hildebrandt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ooi et al., 2014</xref>) water (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sofi et al., 2014</xref>), housing effects, genetic background (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Deloris Alexander et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hildebrand et al., 2013</xref>) and a wide range of other environmental and stress-related factors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bangsgaard Bendtsen et al., 2012</xref>). Many of these variables are likely to differ across germ-free animal facilities and account for the small but measurable differences in OMM<sup>12</sup> community composition observed in our study. Further, due to facility-specific differences in procedures and experimental protocols, it was not possible to match sex, age and number of inoculated mice and obtain fecal samples at matched time points post inoculation. This may account for part of the facility-dependent differences and should be optimized in future trials.</p><p>Our results suggest that a double-dose application with a 72 h interval improves the engraftment of <italic>Muribaculum intestinale</italic> YL27. Representatives of the Muribaculaceae family (former S24-7) are highly diverse and dominant members of the murine gut microbiota (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lagkouvardos et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27, the first cultured representative, is strictly anaerobic and genome-based prediction indicates the potential to degrade complex carbohydrates (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lagkouvardos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, <italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27 showed slow colonization dynamics after oral inoculation compared to all other OMM<sup>12</sup> strains disclose that expansion time can take up to 20 days. The oxidation/reduction (O/R) potential is increased in germ-free mice (+200 mV) compared to conventional mice but becomes reduced in response to colonization with a complex microbiota (−200 mV) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Celesk et al., 1976</xref>). As <italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27 is oxygen-sensitive, we reason that high O/R potential in the germ-free mouse gut may inhibit its expansion early after inoculation. Although a recent study showed that the luminal contents of germ-free mice can chemically consume oxygen (e.g., via lipid oxidation reactions), the gut lumen of germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice may also exhibit increased luminal oxygen concentration compared to mice colonized with a complex microbiota (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>). Oxygen-tolerant members of the microbiota are among the first colonizers in a germ-free environment, after antibiotic treatment or in the course of intestinal colonization of the neonatal gut. They are thought to consume oxygen and anaerobic electron acceptors and to reduce the O/R potential sufficiently for oxygen-sensitive strains to colonize (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Reese et al., 2018</xref>). Presumably, colonization dynamics of the OMM<sup>12</sup> consortium are subject to similar principles: Some members of the consortium (<italic>Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium longum</italic>) that are also among the early colonizers of the human neonatal gut predominate at early colonization stages. Obligate anaerobic bacteria (<italic>Bacteroides acidifaciens</italic>, Clostridiales) follow with a delay of 3 days. We assume that a second dose of OMM<sup>12</sup> administered when the O/R potential has already been lowered by the initial colonizers increases the chance of successful engraftment of obligate anaerobes such as <italic>Muribaculum intestinale</italic>.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that germ-free mice in different facilities can be reproducibly associated with the OMM<sup>12</sup> synthetic bacterial community, employing a protocol using previously frozen aliquots of a mixture of the strains. Furthermore, application of the consortium at two consecutive time points increased the chance of community engraftment. We envision that guidelines and validated protocols for generation of gnotobiotic models based on synthetic microbial communities will contribute to optimizing experimental reproducibility in this intense area of research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern, Kantonales Veterinäramt Zürich, and the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (LAVES).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>BS and CE conceived and designed the experiments.

The major characteristic of GF rodents is an enlarged cecum. The accumulation of mucopolysaccharides, digestion enzymes and water in the intestinal lumen drives this phenotype. Microbial colonization normalizes the cecum size in ex-GF animals. However, whether strain genetics influences the cecal enlargement is unknown. Here we investigated the impact of mouse genetic background on the cecal size in five GF strains frequently used in biomedical research. The cecal weight of GF mice on B6 background (B6J and B6N) represented up to 20% of total body weight. GF NMRI and BALBc mice showed an intermediate phenotype of 5–10%, and those on the C3H background of up to 5%. Reduced cecal size in GF C3H mice correlated with decreased water content, increased expression of water transporters, and reduced production of acidic mucins, but was independent of the level of digestive enzymes in the lumen. In contrast, GF B6J mice with greatly enlarged cecum showed increased water content and a distinct metabolic profile characterized by altered amino acid and bile acid metabolism, and increased acidic mucin production. Together, our results show that genetic background influences the cecal enlargement by regulating the water transport, production of acidic mucins, and metabolic profiles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>germ-free animal models</kwd><kwd>genetic background</kwd><kwd>microbiota-dependent influences on host physiology</kwd><kwd>cecal enlargement</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>digestive enzymes</kwd><kwd>mucins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>German Research Foundation (DFG)</funding-source><award-id>395357507—“SFB 1371”</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Federal Ministry of Education and Research</funding-source><award-id>BMBF</award-id><award-id>FKZ 01EA1906F</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG)—project number 395357507—“SFB 1371” and by the Joint Action “European Joint Programming Initiative “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life” (JPI HDHL)” and the respective national/regional funding organization: Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 01EA1906F).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-nutrients-15-00636"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Germ-free (GF) animal models represent a unique tool to study the function and impact of gut microbiota on the host under homeostatic or pathologic conditions. GF animals can be selectively colonized with specific microorganisms of interest or even microbial communities. Therefore, these models are frequently employed to decipher complex interactions between the host and its endogenous commensal microbiota, as well as to study interrelations between microbial species within the specific biotope such as the intestine [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The first GF animals were already generated by the late 19th century, and the first GF rodents were available in the 1940s [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Approximately 100 years later, with the increased interest in the microbiome research, GF animals were placed in the spotlight again. </p><p>Life in the absence of intestinal microbiota is associated with various anatomical and physiological abnormalities [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The lack of microbial enzymes has a crucial impact on the metabolism of GF animals. In particular, the transformation of primary to secondary bile acids, as well as gut microbiota produced short-chain fatty acids and vitamins, are absent in GF animals [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, GF animals have an underdeveloped immune system that is characterized by reduced gut-associated lymphoid tissue, low numbers of splenic and intestinal T helper cells, and the decreased production of intestinal immunoglobulin A due to reduced antigen priming [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the most prominent characteristics of GF rodents is an enlarged cecum [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several factors that mediate this phenotypic characteristic of GF animals were proposed. The absence of intestinal microbes and their enzymes results in an altered osmolarity within the intestinal lumen. Mucopolysaccharides, which naturally undergo microbial degradation in the colonized gut, retain water and cause the dilatation of the cecum. Furthermore, the dilatation process is additionally supported by the low concentration of chlorine anions and intestinal atonia due to increased trypsin levels [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The colonization of GF rodents with intestinal bacteria normalizes the cecal size to the size observed in colonized animals within a few weeks [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the cecal size in GF rodents increases with age [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Greatly increased cecum can promote cecal torsion causing obstruction of the digestive tract followed by the partial constriction of the blood supply and the death of the animal with or without previous clinical symptoms such as abdominal distension, lack of feces, ragged fur, hypoactivity, and ataxia [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p><p>The contribution of the intestinal microbiota to the reduction of cecal dilatation is well documented. However, whether and how the host genetic background contributes to the degree of cecal enlargement is unknown. Therefore, in this study we assessed the cecal enlargement of all GF wild-type strains available at the Gnotobiotic unit of the Hannover Medical School. Five wild-type GF strains including the GF C57BL/6JZtm (B6J), C57BL/6NRjZtm (B6N), NMRI/MaxZtm (NMRI), Balb/cJZtm (BALBc), and C3H/HeOuJ (C3H) models frequently applied in biomedical research were analyzed to investigate the contribution of the host genetic factors on the cecal size in the absence of intestinal microbiota.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-15-00636"><title>2.

Mice and Sample Collection</title><p>Adult germ-free (GF) male and female NMRI/MaxZtm (NMRI), C57BL/6JZtm (B6J), Balb/cJZtm (BALBc), C3H/HeOuJZtm (C3H), and C57BL/6NRjZtm (B6N) mice were obtained from the Central Animal Facility (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany). Due to the breeding strategy of the gnotobiotic colonies, the NMRI mice are also classified as an inbred strain. GF animals were maintained and bred in plastic film isolators (Metall + Plastik GmbH, Radolfzell-Stahringen, Germany). The offspring of ex-GF B6J and C3H mice colonized with complex microbiota was used to assess the impact of microbial colonization on the host genetic factors. Complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice were housed in individually ventilated cages under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions. The environment of the animal rooms was controlled and standardized with 12-hour light/dark cycles. The health monitoring of SPF and GF animals was performed according to FELASA [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and recommendations for maintaining gnotobiotic colonies [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], respectively.

Both GF and SPF rodents received pelleted 50 kGy gamma-irradiated feed (Complete feed for mice—breeding (M-Z), V1124-927), ssniff Spezialitäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) and autoclaved water ad libitum. At the age of 12 (±1) weeks, the mice were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation followed by cervical dislocation or exsanguination. Body weight, cecal weight and the weight of wet cecal content were recorded during the necropsy. To calculate the percentage of water and solid matter in cecal content, samples of wet cecal content were placed in the tube and incubated with open lids at 90 °C overnight. The next day the weight of the tube with dry cecal matter was recorded and the weight of the solid cecal matter was calculated. Additionally, cecal and colonic tissue (with fecal pellet) were collected for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. Blood was collected to perform a plasma analysis of liver and pancreatic enzymes. Cecal content, cecal and pancreatic tissue were collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-15-00636"><title>2.2.

The bioconductor/R package xcms [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was used for data processing and feature identification. More specifically, the matchedFilter algorithm was used to identify peaks (full width at half maximum set to 7.5 s). The peaks were then grouped into features using the “peak density” method [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The area under the peak was integrated to represent the abundance of features. The retention time was adjusted based on the peak groups presented in most samples. Missing values were first imputed using the “filling” methods provided by “xcms”, which integrated the intensity area according to the features’ retention time and mass range. The remaining missing values were then imputed with half of the limit of detection (LOD) methods; i.e., for very low abundant features, the missing values were replaced with half of the minimal measured value of that feature in all measurements. To annotate features with the names of metabolites, the exact mass and MS2 fragmentation pattern of the measured features were compared to the records in HMBD [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the public MS/MS spectra in MSDIAL [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], referred to as MS1 and MS2 annotation, respectively.

Quantitative determination was performed as described previously, measuring the time needed for the drop of 0.1 pH unit in the solution [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, for trypsin analysis, calibration standards were created by diluting trypsin stock solution (1 mg/mL, T0303, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) 1:2; 1:5; 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:250, and 1:500 in trypsin buffer (0.354 g Tris-HCl, 0.334 g Tris, 2.34 g NaCl (0.04 M), and 2.94 g CaCl<sub>2</sub> dihydrate (0.02 M) in 1L of distilled water, pH 8.2). A substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 2.075 g TAME (T4626, Merck) in a 50 mL trypsin buffer. For trypsin measurement, 2 mL of sample or standard solutions were mixed with 5.5 mL trypsin buffer and 2.5 mL substrate solution in a tube on a magnetic stirrer using a small metal staple as disposable stirrer. The pH of the solution was adjusted to just above 8.2 (with 0.2 M NaOH), and the time for pH decline from 8.2 to 8.1 was noted. For a chymotrypsin assay, enzyme stock solution (1mg/mL, C4129, Merck) was utilized for standard dilutions (1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:250, 1:500) in a chymotrypsin buffer (0.532 g Tris-HCl, 0.198 g Tris, 2.925 g NaCl (0.05 M), and 0.735 g CaCl<sub>2</sub> dihydrate (0.05 M) in 1L of distilled water, pH 7.8). The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 0.454 g ATEE (A6751, Merck) in 25 mL methanol and filled up to 50 mL with the chymotrypsin buffer. The analysis of luminal chymotrypsin was performed as described above, but a pH drop from 7.8 to 7.7 was recorded. Measurements were performed twice by readjusting the pH values of samples or standard mixtures and recording the time again using a pH-Meter 766 (Knick Labor, Germany). All measurements were conducted at room temperature. A standard curve was constructed by plotting time values and standard concentration values applying a log-log linear regression model. Enzyme concentrations were calculated from the standard curve and expressed as µg/mL. The chymotrypsin values for GF and SPF B6J mice were very low. The values that were outside the lowest range of the chymotrypsin standard curve were designated as 0 µg/mL chymotrypsin. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8dot2-nutrients-15-00636"><title>2.8.2.

For the aging cohort, this was defined as the moment when the abdomen of the GF animals was visibly magnified (due to the greatly enlarged cecum) and started to interfere with the locomotor activity of the animal. The cecal enlargement was the major reason for sacrificing B6J mice, as the abdomen of GF mice dilated to the proportions that interfered with the locomotor ability of the affected mice.

Cecal Enlargement Varies between Different Germ-Free Strains</title><p>To determine whether the genetic background plays a role in cecal enlargement in the absence of intestinal microbiota, five wild-type germ-free (GF) strains including NMRI, BALBc, C3H, B6J and B6N were phenotypically analyzed. The cecum of GF mice takes up a large portion of the abdominal cavity (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figure S1A</xref>). The average body weight of 12 week old GF BALBc, C3H, B6J and B6N mice was around 25 g and comparable between strains. GF NMRI mice were heavier and showed an average body weight of 30 g. Furthermore, sex specific differences in body weight were observed in all analyzed GF strains, with males weighing more than females (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Cecal weight including cecal tissue and intestinal content was determined, and strain specific differences were observed (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). GF mice on the B6 genetic background (B6J and B6N) had the largest cecal weight, and mice with C3H had the smallest cecal weight. Furthermore, the percentage of cecal weight of the body weight for each strain was determined (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). In GF B6J and B6N mice, the cecal weight represented up to 20% of the total body weight. The cecal size in GF NMRI and BALBc mice was intermediate and represented between 5–10% of the total body weight. The cecum weight of GF C3H mice corresponded to approximately 5% of the total body weight. Interestingly, only GF B6J mice showed sex differences of the cecal enlargement, with males having a larger cecum than females (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). As intestinal microbiota reduces the cecum size, we analyzed whether the differences in cecal size observed in the GF status were also present in complex microbiota colonized mice. To this end, the offspring of GF B6J and C3H mice born with complex intestinal microbiota was analyzed. As expected, the cecum of complex microbiota colonized mice was much smaller than in GF mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figure S1B</xref>). Complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice similar to GF mice showed sex specific differences in body weight, with males weighing more than females. The average body weight of complex microbiota colonized C3H mice was higher than that of B6J mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). However, when comparing the cecal weight and the percentage of cecal weight in total body weight between complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice, mice with the C3H genetic background still had significantly reduced cecal size, but this difference was much less pronounced (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G,H). Moreover, not only the cecum size, but also the coloring of the cecal content was different between GF mice with larger and smaller cecum. Particularly in GF mice on the B6 genetic background (B6J and B6N), the color of the cecal content was dark brown to black (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). As the dark color of intestinal content suggests the presence of blood, we analyzed the cecal content of GF B6J mice by the fecal occult blood test. However, no blood in cecal content of GF B6J mice was found (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>I), indicating that the distinct coloring of the intestinal content is probably due to different metabolic properties. Altogether, these results show that the genetic background determines the phenotypic characteristics of the cecum. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-15-00636"><title>3.2. Host Genetic Background Shapes Distinct Metabolic Profiles in The Gf Mice Cecum</title><p>The intestinal content of GF mice contains increased water concentrations [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of genetic background on the amount of water and solid matter in the cecal content. To analyze this, wet cecal content was collected and dried to determine the percentage of water and solid matter. The amount of water correlated with the cecal weight (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). The water content was the highest in GF B6J and B6N mice, intermediate in GF NMRI and BALBc mice, and the lowest in GF C3H mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B). The amount of solid matter was inversely correlated to the cecum size, as GF mice with B6 genetic background had the lowest levels and GF C3H the highest levels of cecal solid matter (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B,C). Cecum size increases with the age of the animal and it can lead to the twisting of the cecum, when greatly enlarged, and cause intestinal obstruction followed by the death of the animal. To assess the impact of the cecal size on the average lifespan of GF mice, we followed two aging cohorts of mice on the B6J and C3H genetic background. The average lifespan of GF B6J mice was shorter than that of GF mice with the C3H background (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). In contrast to GF mice with the C3H genetic background, GF B6J mice reached humane end-points at around one year of age. At that age, GF B6J mice were euthanized primarily due to health issues induced by the enlarged cecum. Due to the significantly enlarged cecum, the abdomen of B6J mice was significantly larger, and this influenced the locomotor activity of these mice. The C3H aging cohort did not reach a humane end-point due to health issues associated with the enlarged cecum, and was sacrificed at experimental end-points. Furthermore, we also analyzed the composition of cecal content of complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice. The presence of intestinal microbiota strongly reduced the percentage of water and increased the amount of solid matter in cecal content (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E–G). No difference in water and solid mater in the intestinal content was observed between colonized B6J and C3H mice, supporting the strong impact of intestinal microbiota on the host phenotype.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the metabolic profiles of GF B6J and C3H mice using a mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics approach. Combining positive and negative ionization mode, 2402 metabolic features were detected in total (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). The principal component (PC) analysis clearly separates the B6J and C3H mice on PC1, accounting for over 40% of total variance in the data (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H,I). This result indicates the distinct metabolic profile of host- and food-derived metabolites in the two strains. From a total of 2402 metabolic features, 310 (106 in negative and 204 in positive ion mode) were significantly altered between GF B6J and C3H (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, false discovery rate). Quite a proportion of detected metabolic features were poorly or not annotated, so we focused on the analysis of well-annotated features based on their respective MS1 and MS2. This finally included 22 (17 in positive and 5 in negative ion mode; <xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>J, <xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figures S3 and S4</xref>) distinctly regulated metabolic features between GF B6J and C3H mice. In addition, the metabolites genistein, tauro-α-muricholic acid, L-proline, L-threonine, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid, thymidine, and diferuloyl putrescine were detected in both ion modes. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on these metabolic features, and they were visualized using a heat map (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>J). In addition, their expression profiles were shown using beeswarm plots (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figures S5 and S6</xref>). The changes in metabolic profiles between GF B6J and C3H mice of these well-annotated metabolites involved changes in the metabolism of amino acids, primary bile acids and plant-derived compounds (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>J). In contrast to GF C3H mice, GF B6J mice showed a higher abundance of amino acids such as L-proline, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid, L-arginine and L-threonine in their cecal content. Changes in amino acid metabolism were also supported by metabolic pathway analysis using a pathway-based analysis tool (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>K). One of upregulated metabolites found in GF B6J mice was also L- pyroglumatic acid. This is particularly interesting as the sodium salt of pyroglutamic acid displays water-absorbing properties, indicating that the increased water in the cecal lumen of B6J mice could be due to the presence of water-absorbing substances. Besides changes in the amino acid metabolism, GF B6J mice also had a higher abundance of tauro-α-muricholic acid, which is a taurine-conjugated form of the murine-specific primary bile acid α-muricholic acid. The distinct expression profiles of diferuloyl putrescine (phenolamide) and sissotrin (isoflavone) in GF C3H, as well as genistein (isoflavone), O-malonylgenistin (isoflavone) and α-tocopherol acetate (synthetic form of vitamin E) in GF B6J mice, indicate that mice with different genetic backgrounds differently metabolize food-derived compounds. Moreover, GF B6J mice also showed a higher expression of a lysophospholipid LysoPC 16:0 in the cecal content, suggesting that lipid metabolism pathways also differ between these two strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-nutrients-15-00636"><title>3.3. Reduced Cecal Size Correlates with Higher Water Transportation across the Epithelial Barrier</title><p>As cecal enlargement was associated with increased water content in GF mice, and we next assessed the two main water transport pathways. Water can be transported across the gut epithelium by the paracellular (between cells) and transcellular (through the cell) routes [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The paracellular route involves a passive transport process regulated by a tight junction. Thus, we investigated the expression of tight junction genes Zonula occludens 1 (ZO1), claudin 2 (pore-forming claudin), and claudin 4 and 8 (sealing claudins). The gene expression of tight junctions was comparable between all five GF strains with minor genetic background-induced differences in gene expression of ZO1 and claudin 4 (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A–D). Furthermore, we also assessed additional barrier determining factors such as mucin 2 expression and epithelial cell proliferation. GF B6J mice showed higher mucin 2 gene expression than GF B6N mice. Mucin 2 gene expression was also higher in GF BALBc when compared to GF NMRI and B6N mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Epithelial cell proliferation was determined by the staining of cecal tissues with Ki67 proliferation marker. GF mice on the B6 genetic background showed slightly reduced epithelial cell proliferation. However, no statistically significant difference between all five GF strains was detected (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F,G). These results indicate that increased paracellular permeability regulated by the gene expression of tight junctions is not responsible for observed differences in water content between the five GF mouse strains. However, different distributions of these proteins alongside the intestinal barrier that is independent of changes in gene expression cannot be excluded with this analysis as a potential factor in regulating paracellular water transport. As water is also cotransported with sodium and sugar, we next analyzed the gene expression of two solute transporters: the facilitated glucose transporter (<italic toggle="yes">Slc2a5</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Glut5</italic>) and the sodium/glucose cotransporter (<italic toggle="yes">Slc5a1</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Sglt1</italic>).

Additionally, the gene expression of facilitated glucose transporter <italic toggle="yes">Slc2a5</italic> was also higher in GF C3H mice in comparison to GF BALBc and NMRI mice, indicating higher water absorption from cecal lumen in GF C3H mice. In addition, a Pearson correlation analysis showed that there is a negative correlation between the water content and the <italic toggle="yes">Slc5a1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Slc2a5</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figure S7</xref>). </p><p>Water can also be transported through aquaporins (AQPs), a family of water-channel proteins that are expressed on intestinal epithelial cells [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, we also determined the gene expression of AQP1 and AQP4 in the cecal tissue. The gene expression of AQP1 was comparable between all strains (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). The gene expression of AQP1 was upregulated only in GF C3H mice in comparison with GF NMRI mice. Additionally, GF B6N mice also showed increased AQP1 gene expression when compared with GF BALBc mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). The gene expression of AQP4 in cecal tissue showed more pronounced genetic background differences. GF C3H mice showed significantly upregulated AQP4 gene expression in comparison with GF B6J, B6N and NMRI mice. In addition, GF BALBc mice also had a higher gene expression of AQP4 in comparison with GF NMRI and B6J mice. However, no correlation between AQP4 gene expression and water content was determined (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="app">Figure S7</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that the gene expression of solute and water transporters is increased in GF C3H mice, suggesting a higher water absorption from the cecal lumen in these mice. </p><p>Furthermore, we also analyzed the microbial influence on solute transporters and AQPs gene expression in complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice. The difference in the gene expression of glucose transporter <italic toggle="yes">Slc2a5</italic> observed in GF B6J and C3H mice were eliminated in colonized mice, indicating that the gene expression of these genes can be regulated by intestinal microbiota (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). Interestingly, the difference in the gene expression pattern of the sodium/glucose cotransporter between GF C3H and B6J mice was also observed in complex microbiota colonized mice, indicating that the gene expression of <italic toggle="yes">Slc5a1</italic> is at least partially genetically determined (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). The colonization status did not change the gene expression pattern of AQP1 between microbiota colonized C3H and B6J mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G). The gene expression of AQP4 did not differ between C3H and B6J microbiota colonized mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H), indicating that the expression of this gene can potentially be influenced by intestinal microbiota. Altogether, these data suggest that the decreased expression of solute/water transporters and water channels could be responsible for water accumulation in B6J mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-nutrients-15-00636"><title>3.4.

To analyze whether the differences in cecal size between GF B6J and C3H mice is due to the distinct production and secretion of intestinal mucins, cecal tissues were stained with Alcian blue (AB) and periodic acid—Schiff (PAS) techniques. Alcian blue staining at a pH of 2.5 stained acid mucins deep blue (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B). The quantification of AB positive cells in the cecal tissue of GF B6J and C3H mice showed that the number of AB positive cells in GF B6J was significantly higher than in GF C3H mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). Moreover, we also compared the average size of AB stained granules. However, there was no difference in the size of acidic mucin granules between GF B6J and C3H mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D). When comparing the number of AB positive cells as well as the average size of AB stained granules between complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice, no difference was observed. However, in comparison with GF mice, only complex microbiota colonized C3H mice showed significantly higher numbers of AB positive cells as well as average granule size than their GF counterparts (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C,D). Similar analyses were performed with PAS staining. PAS staining stained neutral mucins from pink to red (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E,F). The quantification of PAS stained cells in the cecal tissue of GF B6J and C3H mice revealed no difference in the number of PAS positive cells (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G). In addition, no difference in the average size of PAS stained granules between GF B6J and C3H mice was observed (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H). Furthermore, similar to AB staining, no difference between PAS positive cells and their granule size was observed between complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice (5G–H). However, the average size of PAS granules was only significantly increased in complex microbiota colonized C3H mice when compared to GF C3H mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H). As AB and PAS stained granules were bigger in complex microbiota colonized mice, this finding indicates that the intestinal microbiota composition could be responsible for this phenotypic observation. Altogether, these data show that GF B6J mice produce and secrete more acidic mucins in the gut lumen that in turn can retain more water and influence the cecal enlargement. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-nutrients-15-00636"><title>3.5. Reduced Cecal Size in Gf C3h Mice Is Independent of Increased Digestive Enzyme Levels</title><p>The large intestine of GF mice contains increased levels of digestive enzymes, the accumulation of which could also be responsible for the cecal dilatation [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that GF C3H mice in comparison with GF B6J mice show decreased levels of digestive enzymes. As both the liver and pancreas support digestion processes, we first analyzed liver and pancreatic enzymes in the plasma of both GF and complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice. The parameters for assessment of liver function involved the analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin. Plasma levels of ALP (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A), AST (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B) and bilirubin (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) were comparable between GF and complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice. Only GF C3H mice showed decreased plasma levels of ALT in comparison with GF B6J mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). The pancreas produces three types of digestion enzymes: lipase, amylase and protease. Pancreatic lipase and amylase are secreted as active enzymes. The level of pancreatic lipase and amylase were thus determined in the plasma. GF and complex microbiota colonized mice on the C3H background secreted decreased levels of pancreatic lipase in comparison with GF and complex microbiota colonized B6J mice, indicating a strain-specific characteristic (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). No differences in the plasma level of amylase were observed between GF and colonized B6J and C3H mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F). Furthermore, all pancreatic digestive proteases are secreted as inactivated enzymes. Therefore, to analyze whether GF B6J mice secrete more trypsinogen than GF C3H mice, we examined its production in the pancreas by measuring the gene expression of serine protease 2 (<italic toggle="yes">Prss2</italic>). No difference in the gene expression of trypsinogen in the pancreas was observed between GF and colonized B6J and C3H mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>G). We then analyzed the levels of activated digestive proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin in the cecal content. Both GF B6J and C3H mice displayed high levels of luminal trypsin. However, no differences between luminal trypsin activity (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H), concentration (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I) and immunostaining (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>J) were detected between GF B6J and C3H mice. In comparison with GF B6J and C3H mice, complex microbiota colonized B6J and C3H mice had substantially lower levels of luminal trypsin (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H–J). Luminal chymotrypsin levels were elevated in GF C3H mice in comparison with GF B6J (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>K). Furthermore, luminal chymotrypsin levels were reduced in complex microbiota colonized C3H mice and were mostly below the detection level in both GF and microbiota colonized B6J mice (<xref rid="nutrients-15-00636-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>K). Altogether, these data suggest that the reduced cecal size in GF C3H mice is not mediated through decreased levels of digestive enzymes in the intestinal content.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-nutrients-15-00636"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The intestinal microbiota has an immense influence on host physiology and metabolism. The absence of intestinal microbial communities causes anatomical and physiological changes in living organisms. The most representative characteristic of germ-free (GF) rodents is the highly dilated cecum in response to the sterile environment. This specific phenotype was described as early as the first GF guinea pigs were generated [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The role of intestinal microbiota on the cecal size is well described. The colonization of GF animals reduces the cecal size to the one observed in colonized animals, whereas the antibiotic treatment of complex microbiota colonized animals increases the cecum size [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, whether the host genetics influences the cecal enlargement is unknown. Here, we show that the strain background genetics determines the proportion of the cecal dilatation. In this study, we studied the cecal enlargement in five GF wild-type strains that are used in biomedical research. We showed that the cecal weight in GF B6J and C3H mice represented 20% and 5% of the total body weight, respectively. In addition, in two other strains, BALBc and NMRI, the cecal weight represented between 5 and 10% of the total body weight. These results confirmed that the host-mediated factors also shape the cecal enlargement in the absence of intestinal microbiota. The factors that were implicated in the cecal enlargement besides the presence of microorganisms are the increased secretion of water and electrolytes, the accumulation of mucins, undigested fibers, and host-mediated bioactive substances, together with decreased gut motility [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As GF C3H mice had reduced cecal size in comparison with GF B6J mice, we hypothesized that this is due to reduced water transportation into the lumen and the lower amount of undegraded host-derived substances such as mucins and dietary enzymes. The water content in the cecal lumen of GF C3H mice was lower than in GF B6J mice, and this was associated with the increased gene expression of solute transporters <italic toggle="yes">Slc2a5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Slc5a1</italic>, as well as aquaporin 4. As water is cotransported with sodium and sugars across the intestinal epithelium, this suggests increased water absorption in GF C3H mice [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, previous studies showed that dietary nonabsorbable polymer polyethylene glycol induces the hypertrophy of the rat cecum and stimulates sodium transport [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, aquaporins (AQPs), water-channel proteins that are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, are involved in water transport across the epithelium and play a role in the dehydration process of fecal contents [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B47-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The decreased expression of AQP4 was associated with the induction of allergic or infection-related diarrhea and intestinal inflammation [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Previous findings suggested that the water retention in the cecal lumen of GF animals is due to the presence of osmotically active substances [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This is in line with our metabolomic data that show the increased presence of L- pyroglumatic acid (PCA) in the cecal lumen of GF B6J mice. The PCA, a naturally occurring component of mammalian tissue, and its derivates are classified as humectants (water-absorbing substances) [<xref rid="B52-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. GF B6J mice also showed significantly higher levels of taurine-conjugated primary bile acids in the cecal lumen. As bile acids can also inhibit water transport and motility in the large intestine, their increased levels in B6J could contribute to the greatly enlarged cecum [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B53-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The difference in the primary bile acid concentration points to an endogenous effect and is not dependent on the food. Besides these differences, GF B6J and GF C3H mice differently metabolize food-derived components independently of the intestinal microbiota. The metabolism of plant-derived genistein, an isoflavone, differs between these two strains. The naturally occurring form as well its glycoside form, O-malonylgenistin, were more expressed in the cecal content of GF B6J mice, whereas in GF C3H mice a methylated and glycosylated form of genistein, sissotrin, was found. Distinct metabolic profiles also involved plant-derived phenolamide, diferuloyl putrescine, and the diet supplemented synthetic form of vitamin E, α-tocoperol acetate, expressed more in GF C3H and GF B6J mice, respectively. This supports the findings that the genetic background influences phenotypic properties [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Additionally, these two GF strains also showed changes in the amino acid metabolism. GF B6J mice had increased expression profiles of certain amino acids such as L-proline, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid, L-arginine and L-threonine in their cecal lumen. These amino acids were attributed to different pathways with the highest impact on the glutamine and glutamate metabolism. Glutamine and glutamate are important for the maintenance and promotion of the cell functions such as serving as an energy source, promoting enterocyte proliferation, tight junction regulation, and the suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling [<xref rid="B58-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As the difference between digestive enzymes between GF B6J and GF C3H mice were not significant, the higher level of amino acids in the lumen of GF B6J could potentially be due to their reduced absorption. Water uptake influences the absorption of amino acids from the lumen [<xref rid="B60-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. As GF B6J mice have reduced water transport and more water in the lumen than GF C3H mice, this could influence the difference in the amino acid levels between these two strains. The accumulation of unabsorbed and partially undigested proteins in the cecum such as mucins and dietary enzymes has also been proposed as a contributing factor to the cecum dilatation. Mucins are large, highly glycosylated proteins that are categorized into neutral and acidic subtypes that build up the mucus layer in the intestine [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The mucin glycans are hydrophilic and bind water to form a gel-like mucus layer that protects epithelial cells from dehydration and mechanical stress [<xref rid="B64-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The accumulation of mucins in the GF lumen was suggested to be due to the absence of mucus-degrading bacteria rather than the increased production of mucins [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The gene expression of the mucin 2 gene, the main component of the mucus in the large intestine, was not altered between GF B6J and C3H mice. However, we showed that GF B6J mice have an increased number of acidic mucin producing cells in the intestinal mucosa, suggesting that the higher production of acidic mucins could contribute to the increased cecal size in these mice. Dietary enzymes are also not absorbed by the intestinal epithelium and thus accumulate in the lumen of GF animals [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We showed that GF C3H mice produce higher levels of luminal chymotrypsin and reduced levels of lipase in the blood. The increased lipase activity in GF B6J mice could be due to the increased expression of LysoPC 16:0 in the cecal content, as detected by metabolomic analyses. No difference in the trypsin activity has been identified between GF B6J and C3H mice, supporting the hypothesis that the accumulation and production of dietary enzymes is not mediating the difference in cecal size between these two strains. We also confirmed marked differences in the trypsin levels between GF and complex microbiota colonized mice. This is in line with the recent publication in which specific intestinal taxa responsible for trypsin degradation in the large intestine was identified [<xref rid="B65-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Immunohistological trypsin staining supported the proposed mechanism of trypsin degradation by trypsin recruitment to the surface of commensal bacteria, as bacteria-like structures in the lumen were stained with trypsin antibody. GF animals were shown to live longer than mice on the same genetic background colonized with intestinal microbiota, and do not develop signs of inflammaging [<xref rid="B66-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, a greatly enlarged cecum can cause health issues in aged GF animals. Cecal torsion due to a greatly enlarged cecum was described as the major health issue in aged GF animals [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-15-00636" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Using two aging cohorts, we showed that the expected lifespan of GF B6J is shorter than that of GF C3H mice. GF B6J mice were sacrificed at approximately 1 year of age, as their abdomens became significantly larger due to the enlarged cecum, and this led to locomotor difficulties. In addition, we did not observe any cecal twisting in these cohorts.

The kinetic proofreading model posits that certain T-cell antigen receptor signaling nodes serve as molecular timers to facilitate such discrimination. However, the physiological significance of this regulatory mechanism and the pathological consequences of disrupting it are unknown. Here we report that accelerating the normally slow phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) residue Y136 by introducing an adjacent Gly135Asp alteration (LAT<sup>G135D</sup>) disrupts ligand discrimination in vivo. The enhanced self-reactivity of LAT<sup>G135D</sup> T cells triggers excessive thymic negative selection and promotes T-cell anergy. During <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, LAT<sup>G135D</sup> T cells expand more than wild-type counterparts in response to very weak stimuli but display an imbalance between effector and memory responses. Moreover, despite their enhanced engagement of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms, mice bearing LAT<sup>G135D</sup> show features associated with autoimmunity and immunopathology. Our data reveal the importance of kinetic proofreading in balancing tolerance and immunity.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Lo and colleagues provide evidence for the TCR kinetic proofreading model by LAT Gly135Asp alteration to reveal functional consequences of altered kinetics in TCR activation in thymic selection and mature T-cell responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Signal transduction</kwd><kwd>Immune tolerance</kwd><kwd>Infection</kwd><kwd>T-cell receptor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Division of Intramural Research of the NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI143960</award-id><award-id>AI137209</award-id><award-id>AI147641</award-id><award-id>AI167422</award-id><award-id>AI091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lo</surname><given-names>Wan-Lin</given-names></name><name><surname>Rizzuto</surname><given-names>Gabrielle</given-names></name><name><surname>Evavold</surname><given-names>Brian D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100008235</institution-id><institution>U of U | School of Medicine (University of Utah School of Medicine)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100007052</institution-id><institution>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004410</institution-id><institution>Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TUBITAK-2232b 121C115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekiz</surname><given-names>H.

The goal of TCR ligand discrimination is that agonist peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers T-cell responses, whereas self-pMHC signals maintain T-cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Improper TCR ligand discrimination can cause autoimmunity and other immune-mediated diseases. Notably, TCR affinity for an agonist or self-pMHC may differ by only ten- to 15-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, TCR affinity for pMHC ligands is in the micromolar range, contrasting the binding affinities of B cell receptors, cytokine receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases for their ligands, which are often in the nanomolar range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These TCR characteristics make it difficult for T cells to reliably discriminate between self- and foreign pMHCs, to modulate the quality and quantity of resulting responses and to balance between immunity and tolerance. Several models have attempted to explain how T cells distinguish between self-peptides and foreign ligands, but in vivo evidence has been limited and the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic.</p><p id="Par4">The kinetic proofreading model suggests that a series of signaling events, some of which may include nodes that function as critical molecular timers, set an activation threshold for T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In essence, a ligand must bind to the TCR for long enough to initiate a series of reversible kinetic proofreading events to be considered a bona fide TCR activation signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Typically, when a self-pMHC engages a TCR, the binding lifetime is too short to initiate all of the necessary proofreading events to activate the T cell, although it may induce responses that contribute to cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Consistent with the kinetic proofreading model, adaptation to intrinsic signaling events and modification of the signaling network (for example, upregulation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or other negative regulators) can fine-tune the activation threshold in T cells.

We generated a mouse model featuring T cells with altered kinetic proofreading by replacing Gly residue 135 with a negatively charged Asp residue (LAT<sup>G135D</sup>). In the thymus, LAT<sup>G135D</sup> T cells are subjected to increased negative selection. In the periphery, the expression of LAT<sup>G135D</sup> promotes specific phenotypic and functional adaptations, such as upregulation of CD5 and CD6 and induction of T-cell anergy. Strikingly, despite acquiring characteristics of enhanced tolerance in the thymus and in the periphery, LAT<sup>G135D</sup> T cells retain augmented sensitivity and proliferative fitness in response to infection with <italic>Listeria</italic> strains expressing very weak ligands. However, LAT<sup>G135D</sup> also promotes the terminal differentiation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells and impairs the formation of memory precursors in response to strong TCR stimuli. In addition, by 1 year of age, LAT<sup>G135D</sup> female mice develop higher titers of autoantibodies than wild-type mice, along with signs of colitis. Our work therefore suggests that the rate of LAT Y136 phosphorylation relative to the TCR:pMHC binding lifetime is a critical parameter of TCR ligand discrimination and contributes to T-cell fate determination upon antigen encounter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Modifying T cells with altered TCR signal proofreading</title><p id="Par7">To elucidate the consequences of disrupting a single bona fide kinetic proofreading step in an otherwise intact biological system, we utilized CRISPR–Cas9 technology to introduce a mutation into the endogenous mouse <italic>Lat</italic> locus that would be transcribed as the Gly135Asp alteration (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref>).

However, until now, a lack of animal models allowing manipulation of a bona fide proofreading step has hampered our understanding of the importance of safeguarding TCR ligand discrimination in physiological and pathological settings. Here we generated a robust in vivo mouse model, harboring the LAT<sup>G135D</sup> alteration, in which T cells are hardwired to shorten the time delay for TCR–pMHC input signals to trigger activation. We showed that shortening the time of molecular engagement required for a key step in kinetic proofreading allows antigens with low signal strength that normally fail to generate effective T-cell responses to serve as activating signals. LAT<sup>G135D</sup>-expressing T cells engage robust central and peripheral tolerance and display heightened effector responses to pathogens. However, LAT<sup>G135D</sup>-mediated alterations also impair the formation of memory precursors and predispose female mice to features associated with autoimmunity. Thus, our findings suggest that the slow rate of LAT Y136 phosphorylation establishes a level of proper TCR ligand discrimination that allows T cells to scale responses accordingly to distinguish between ligands spanning a broad range of potencies and affinities. Our results emphasize the importance of slow phosphorylation of LAT Y136 to maintain T-cell unresponsiveness toward self-peptides and, therefore, tolerance.</p><p id="Par26">Editing to shorten the signaling delay after TCR:pMHC engagement revealed the importance of the evolutionarily conserved slow kinetics of the LAT Y136 proofreading step. The primary goal of thymic T-cell development is to generate an anticipatory T-cell repertoire of the greatest possible size to ensure efficient immune responses to foreign pathogens while precluding the development of autoimmunity. However, LAT<sup>G135D</sup> CD8 T cells exhibited restricted cell fates, with skewing toward effector cells, indicative of worse cell fate plasticity during immune responses. Such an imbalance in the ability of LAT<sup>G135D</sup> T cells to adopt various cell fates highlights the evolutionary fitness conferred by proper regulation of the TCR proofreading step. Future experiments are needed to examine the potential impact of the LAT<sup>G135D</sup> alteration upon CD8 T-cell memory responses and to explore the hypothesis that slow kinetic proofreading in mammals has created T cells that utilize TCR ligand discrimination to identify optimal agonistic signals, thereby retaining considerable plasticity to generate effector responses and form memory cells while retaining proper sensitivity to weak ligands.</p><p id="Par27">T-cell ligand discrimination is particularly sensitive to the phosphorylation kinetics of LAT Y136 (among all Zap-70 substrates), plausibly because it is the sole tyrosine associated with PLC-γ1 interaction and function. Our data, together with complementary results by others on mice with a mutation conferring a Tyr136Phe alteration in LAT (LAT<sup>Y136F</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>—in which the recruitment and activation of PLC-γ1 are completely disrupted—provide an opportunity to identify the divergent signaling pathways propagated through different tyrosine residues in LAT. Selective disruption or enhancement of LAT Y136–PLC-γ1 signaling has only a modest effect on ERK signaling, allowing LAT<sup>Y136F</sup> to retain certain LAT signalosome functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and LAT<sup>G135D</sup> to specifically tune PLC-γ1-specific signal transduction. Thus, we postulate that the slow phosphorylation associated with PLC-γ1 signaling and fast phosphorylation associated with Grb2/SOS and ERK/MAPK signaling enable TCR self- and nonself-discrimination to establish pathway specificity within LAT signalosomes. The LAT–PLC-γ1–calcium–NFAT pathway is, by default, the last to be activated after TCR engagement. Our single-amino acid modification of LAT uniquely facilitates NFAT signaling relative to other TCR downstream pathways, consequently altering T-cell development and homeostasis. As a result, LAT Y136 signal augmentation in LAT<sup>G135D</sup> mice results in superior induction of thymic negative selection and peripheral T-cell anergy—the tolerance mechanisms that LAT<sup>Y136F</sup> T cells fail to engage.</p><p id="Par28">Interestingly, we did not observe spontaneous upregulation of coinhibitory receptors, including PD-1, in LAT<sup>G135D</sup> mice, perhaps because the coinhibitory receptors are more distal in the TCR pathway and may be most important to prevent immunopathology once an immune response has been initiated. However, signaling domains that either compete with the LAT signalosome or interact with LAT downstream signaling are upregulated. For example, upregulation of CD5 and CD6 may cause assembly of their respective signalosomes, leading to competition with LAT signalosomes for interacting proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In addition, molecules that directly inhibit signaling downstream of the LAT–PLC-γ1 pathway, such as DGK-ζ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, are also upregulated. Together, our data reveal the elements of downstream TCR signaling that are specifically dependent on LAT–PLC-γ1–calcium–NFAT signals. These results show that the importance of the LAT Y136–PLC-γ1 pathway lies in its duality: it equips T cells with enhanced responsiveness and sensitivity while priming them for tolerance induction. The LAT–PLC-γ1 pathway requires conditions to be just right, as both signaling deficiency and hyperactivity can lead to immunodeficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates an important physiological role of a kinetic proofreading step and unmasks the importance of coordinating signal specificity within LAT signalosomes to reinforce proper TCR ligand discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Experimental models</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par29">The C57BL/6, CD45.1<sup>+</sup>C57BL/6, Nur77–eGFP, MHC-II<sup>–/–</sup>, TAP<sup>–/–</sup>b2m<sup>–/–</sup> or TCR Cα<sup>–/–</sup> mice were housed in specific pathogen-free facilities at the University of California, San Francisco, University of Utah or Technical University of Munich.

The cartoon illustrates the genomic locus of mouse <italic>Lat</italic>. The numbers represent individual exons. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of exon 7 are depicted. The coding regions are listed in capital letters and the intron immediately following exon 7 is shown in lowercase letters. The orange arrows represent the two sgRNAs used to generate the G135D knock-in mice. <bold>b</bold>. Illustration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the engineering strategy. In brief, mammalian T cells express natural (wild-type) LAT, which exhibits slow phosphorylation kinetics upon TCR recognition of ligand; this serves as a proofreading bottleneck to create the molecular time delay required for proper TCR ligand discrimination. Only bona fide activating ligands that interact with the TCR with a sufficiently long bond lifetime pass this slow signaling bottleneck to activate T cells (left). On the other hand, the bond lifetime of an interaction between the TCR and self-pMHC is too short to activate T cells (left). Importantly, the phosphorylation of LAT Y136 is regulated by the amino acid preceding Y136. Natural LAT has a small glycine at the −1 position, leading to slow phosphorylation (right); sequence-modifying LAT with a negatively charged aspartate substantially facilitates the rate and magnitude of Y136 phosphorylation (right). G135D mutant LAT therefore bestows on T cells the ability to respond to very weak ligands or self-peptides. <bold>c</bold>. The PCR genotyping results of the seven pups born to the founder generated with CRISPR/Cas9 using sgRNA #1 and the four pups born to the founder generated with sgRNA #2.

Mismatch between internal and external time, e.g. during shift work, disrupts circadian system coordination promoting the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Conversely, body weight changes induce microbiota dysbiosis. The relationship between circadian disruption and microbiota dysbiosis in metabolic diseases, however, remains largely unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Core and accessory clock gene expression in different gastrointestinal (GI) tissues were determined by qPCR in two different models of circadian disruption - mice with Bmal1 deficiency in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup>), and wild-type mice exposed to simulated shift work (SSW). Body composition and energy balance were evaluated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), bomb calorimetry, food intake and running-wheel activity. Intestinal permeability was measured in an Ussing chamber. Microbiota composition and functionality were evaluated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, PICRUST2.0 analysis and targeted metabolomics. Finally, microbiota transfer was conducted to evaluate the functional impact of SSW-associated microbiota on the host's physiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both chronodisruption models show desynchronization within and between peripheral clocks in GI tissues and reduced microbial rhythmicity, in particular in taxa involved in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) fermentation and lipid metabolism. In Bmal1SCNfl/- mice, loss of rhythmicity in microbial functioning associates with previously shown increased body weight, dysfunctional glucose homeostasis and adiposity. Similarly, we observe an increase in body weight in SSW mice. Germ-free colonization experiments with SSW-associated microbiota mechanistically link body weight gain to microbial changes. Moreover, alterations in expression of peripheral clock genes as well as clock-controlled genes (CCGs) relevant for metabolic functioning of the host were observed in recipients, indicating a bidirectional relationship between microbiota rhythmicity and peripheral clock regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Collectively, our data suggest that loss of rhythmicity in bacteria taxa and their products, which likely originates in desynchronization of intestinal clocks, promotes metabolic abnormalities during shift work.</p></sec></abstract><abstract

id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0190">Most species have evolved endogenous circadian clocks to facilitate adaption to daily recurring changes. A complex hierarchical circadian system consists of a central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus which regulates rhythmic behavior, such as rest-activity, and synchronizes peripheral clocks via neuronal and humoral signals to adapt to environmental changes [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Peripheral circadian clocks have been identified in various organs, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and regulate tissue-specific functions, such as glucocorticoid synthesis and glucose metabolism [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. On the molecular level, the circadian clock consists of a subset of interconnected clock genes which regulate circadian rhythms of tissue-specific clock-controlled genes (CCGs) and thereby control various aspects of physiology [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0195">Mismatch between the internal clock and the environmental time, observed in shift workers, induces circadian desynchronization among peripheral clocks [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Genetically and environmentally induced circadian disruption has been associated with various metabolic and GI diseases including obesity and diabetes [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Similarly, lack of the coordinative input from the central clock results in desynchronization between peripheral clocks and causes an increase in body weight and impaired glucose tolerance [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These results suggest that peripheral circadian desynchronization might be causal for metabolic alterations.</p><p id="p0200">In the context of metabolic disease, human cohort studies have identified altered microbial profiles associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. In agreement with these findings, frequent time zone shifts (jetlag) induce major alterations in overall gut microbiota communities and loss of daytime-dependent oscillation in specific taxa [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Importantly, in large human cohorts we showed that microbiota composition and function undergo 24-h rhythmicity and are disrupted in subjects with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D) [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, our results in prediabetic patients indicate that arrhythmicity of specific taxa precedes the onset of diabetes and a signature of arrhythmic bacteria predicts T2D risk in populations. Of importance, our recent work on mice identified clocks in cells of the GI tract to be the major regulators of microbial rhythmicity and, therefore, GI homeostasis [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consequently, we hypothesize that intestinal clock-controlled oscillation of the microbiome provides a functional link to metabolic requirements of the host to maintain metabolic health.</p><p id="p0205">Here we investigate the impact of circadian disruption on the synchronization of GI clocks and the rhythmicity of microbiota composition and function. Our results show desynchronization of GI clocks in two independent models of circadian disruption, a genetic approach using mice with central circadian dysfunction and an environmental approach using simulated shift work (SSW) on wild type mice. Arrhythmicity of microbial taxa was observed in both models, although microbiota composition differed between experiments.

This prompted us to determine whether circadian desynchronization in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup> mice affects circadian microbiota composition and function. Indeed, 16s rRNA analysis of fecal samples revealed significant clustering according to genotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), suggesting a different microbiota composition in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup>mice.

Relative abundance of the two major phyla, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, showed circadian rhythmicity with similar patterns in both genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). However, previous research, including from our own group, showed that rhythmicity in relative abundance can be masked due to oscillations of highly abundant taxa [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, we used synthetic DNA spikes to determine quantitative microbiota composition as previously described [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Indeed, both phyla lost rhythmicity in quantitative abundance in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup> mice compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Central clock disruption led to loss of rhythmicity of the families <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridiales</italic> independent of the analysis (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Suppl. Figure S1A</xref>). Then we set out to determine rhythmicity of zero-radius OTUs (zOTUs) after removal of low-abundance taxa (mean relative abundance &lt;0.1%; prevalence &lt;10%).

Of note, overall microbiota composition was not comparable between these two experiments performed in different animal facilities (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Suppl. Figure S3H</xref>). However, this is in accordance with frequent reports illustrating that the housing situation dramatically influences microbiota composition [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To consider microbiota function rather than composition, we performed PICRUST analysis of zOTUs which lost rhythmicity in SSW (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I).

Independent of the approach of inducing circadian desynchronization, disrupted rhythmicity and changes in abundance were found in pathways related to amino acids, fatty acids as well as sugar metabolism and SCFA fermentation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>J), suggesting a functional link between circadian microbiota regulation and GI physiology.

Mice receiving SSW-associated microbiota significantly increased their body weight (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), in line with observations following fecal microbiota transplantation from mice exposed to chronic jetlag [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, 6 weeks after transfer, body weight as well as most organ weights were undistinguishable between recipients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A–C), indicating that microbial alterations are temporary in rhythmic hosts. Of note, cecum weight was significantly increased and plasma glucose was slightly enhanced, whereas plasma triglycerides were unchanged following transfer with SSW associated microbiota (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Suppl. Figure S4C</xref>). Microbial derived products, especially SCFAs and BAs have been described to alter clock gene expression in GI tissues [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This prompted us to measure clock gene expression in recipients as well as in GF controls. Indeed, mice receiving SSW-associated microbiota showed altered GI clock gene expression 6 weeks after the transfer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Although most clock genes examined in the proximal colon fluctuated between daytimes independent of the genotype of the donor, <italic>Per2</italic> expression was highly suppressed at ZT13 and the daytime difference of <italic>Rev-erbα</italic> expression in controls was absent in mice receiving SSW-associated microbiota (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Similarly, <italic>Per2, Cry1</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> expression in jejunum as well as <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Rev-erbα</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> expression in cecum was suppressed at ZT13 in mice receiving SSW-associated microbiota. Dampened daytime differences in GI clock gene expression followed similar trends than observations made in donor mice exposed to SSW and in GF mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>I, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). These results suggest that the microbiome can at least partly transfer the GI clock phenotype from the donor to the host and thus directly impact GI physiology. In mice receiving SSW-associated microbiota, we then investigated the effect of clock gene suppression on clock-controlled genes related to glucose and fat metabolism, such as <italic>Fabp2</italic>, <italic>Ifabp, Sglt1</italic>, <italic>Glut2</italic> and <italic>Ppary</italic> [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>]. Indeed, in the jejunum, suppressed expression was found for <italic>Fabp2</italic> involved in lipid uptake [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], <italic>Sglt1</italic> and <italic>Glut2</italic> a regulator for glucose uptake [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

In addition, we provide evidence that GI clocks desynchronize in the absence of a functional central clock. Moreover, we demonstrate that desynchronization among GI clocks also appears in wild type mice exposed to SSW conditions. Our results comply with alterations in colonic clock gene expression following chronic jet lag [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and suggest that GI clock desynchrony is a common feature during circadian disruption. Of note, distinct sections of the GI circadian system responded differentially to circadian disturbances, which was evident in the genetic model and during environmentally induced circadian disruption. Considering previous research indicating a temporal phase gradient of clock gene rhythms along the gut cranio–caudal axis [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the circadian response to circadian disturbance might differ between gut sections. However, 24-hour profiling of clock gene expression over multiple days would be necessary to compare the kinetics of resetting between intestinal tissue clocks in different models. Notably, environmental and genetic circadian disruption influence the feeding fasting cycles differently [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our results in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup> mice demonstrate arrhythmic food intake behavior upon release in DD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), whereas in SSW the daily patterns of food intake continued to be rhythmic but with a shifted phase [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This is in accordance to the wheel running activity rhythms documented in our approach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A,B). As feeding time represents the main <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for peripheral clocks [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], differences in the food intake patterns in SCN-specific Bmal1-deficient mice compared to mice exposed to SSW could impact the intestinal clocks differently and thus might explain the differences in expression patterns of intestinal genes observed in these models.</p><p id="p0340">Recently, we identified that GI clocks are important regulators of gut microbiota rhythmicity [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Previous research identified food intake timing to influence microbial rhythmicity in mice with a defective circadian system [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, arrhythmicity of the microbiota observed in mice with central clock disruption and in mice kept in SSW was likely induced by desynchronization among GI clocks or alteration of fasting-feeding behaviour or a combination of both. In line with recent results obtained from mice with dysfunctional intestinal clocks [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], taxa belonging to the families <italic>Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic> as well as to the genera <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Alistipes</italic> lost rhythmicity in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup> mice and in mice undergoing SSW. Of note, disruption of rhythmicity was more severe in mice lacking a functional central clock. Here, arrhythmicity was found in microbial diversity and on the level of phyla and families. During SSW the abundance of the phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and, thus, a substantial amount of taxa remained rhythmic, although with an advanced phase. This discrepancy between both models might be explained by the accumulative effect of arrhythmic feeding behavior <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), whereas in SSW the daily patterns of food intake were rhythmic but phase shifted [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Manipulating the timing of food intake has been shown to phase shift specific taxa belonging to <italic>Alistipes, Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, a phase-advanced food intake rhythm in SSW could have changed the phase of bacterial oscillations. Nevertheless, a substantial amount of taxa lost rhythmicity upon exposure to SSW and similarly in mice with SCN-specific and GI clock disruption [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], indicating that loss of synchrony between GI clocks during circadian disruption likely is responsible for arrhythmicity of these taxa. Of note, few taxa sustained rhythmicity even during circadian disruption, which might be a results of altered but still functional peripheral clocks, or these taxa are driven by bacteria intrinsic factors.</p><p id="p0345">Recently we discovered a link between microbiota rhythmicity, obesity and T2D development in humans [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting that microbial rhythms may play a causative role for disease development. Accordingly, transfer of microbiota from an obese human donor as well as from lean donors undergoing jetlag induces an obesity-associated phenotype in GF recipient mice [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, these studies did not address whether obesity associated loss of microbial rhythmicity or general changes in abundance of bacteria are the underlying cause. Transfer experiments using mouse models with circadian dysfunction provide direct evidence for the physiological relevance of microbiota rhythms for metabolic health. For example, transfer of arrhythmic microbiota from gut-clock deficient mice disrupts GI homeostasis in recipient animals [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and microbiota from mice exposed to environmentally induces circadian disruption promoting body weight gain in wild type mice. Similar results were obtained following microbiota transfer from jet lagged mice [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that on top of peripheral clock disruption in the fat and liver [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the rhythmicity of the microbiome is a critical factor for the development of metabolic disease.</p><p id="p0350">GI metabolism is strongly influenced by bacterially derived products, such as SCFAs and BAs [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. After both genetic and environmental circadian disruption, loss of microbial rhythmicity was reflected by arrhythmicity of predicted microbial functionality, such as SCFA fermentation, as well as sugar, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Of note, loss of rhythmicity was more prominent on the level of pathways than on single zOTUs, indicating the involvement of oscillating zOTUs in multiple pathways. Targeted metabolite analysis further confirmed lack of rhythmicity of key microbial derived products in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl/-</italic></sup> mice, namely SCFAs and BAs. For example, arrhythmicity was found for the SCFAs Propionic acid and Acetic acid. Both play a major role in fat and glucose metabolism and are capable in preventing diet induced obesity and insulin resistance [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, alterations in either rhythmicity or abundance of taurine-conjugated bile acids as well as the secondary BA Ursodeoxycholic acid were observed. These metabolites are known to impact signaling through the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR, resulting in the transcription of target genes important for lipid and glucose homeostasis (reviewed by [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). Importantly, bacterial metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs, are controlled by the circadian clock, and alterations in SCFA and BA oscillations were previously reported in mice exposed to chronic jet lag and in GI clock deficient animals [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Loss of rhythmicity of SCFAs as well as BAs which are both involved in sugar and fatty acid metabolism (reviewed by [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]) might alter metabolic functionalities of the host following circadian disruption, since both bacterial products are known to balance host metabolism (reviewed by [<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]). In this regard, we previously reported an increased body weight gain, when <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl</italic>/-</sup> mice were kept in DD for multiple weeks [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Of importance, loss of microbiota rhythms and subsequent microbial functions predominantly involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, such as Ursodeoxycholic acid, Propionic acid and Acetic acid [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], were already found at the 2nd day of DD and thus precede the obesity phenotype reported in these mice. Consequently, the observed microbial changes might represent an early event in the development of the metabolic phenotype of <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>SCNfl</italic>/-</sup> mice [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0355">Importantly, shift work associated bacteria induced weight gain, slightly increased plasma glucose levels and directly affected the host's GI clock function. In particular, GI clock dysregulation in donor mice following circadian disruption was partly reflected in recipients. For example, suppression of daytime differences in colonic <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> expression in jejunum was evident in both donor and recipient, indicating that microbiota transfer the circadian phenotype from the donor to recipients. Peripheral circadian clocks are known to control organ functions through regulation of tissue-specific CCGs ([<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Accordingly, GI clock disruption in recipients altered the expression levels of CCGs in jejunum and colon, such as <italic>Fabp2, Sglt1, Ifabp, Glut2</italic> and <italic>Ppary</italic>, both involved in glucose and fat metabolism [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The mechanisms linking microbiota rhythms with functions of the GI tissue likely involve local epithelial–microbial interactions. Indeed, SCFAs and BAs have been reported to directly impact rhythmicity in intestinal epithelial cells and affect metabolic responses of the host [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Consequently, arrhythmicity of the transferred microbiota likely resulted in arrhythmicity of bacterial products, capable to alter GI clock function and, subsequently, metabolic CCGs. Therefore, our results provide first mechanistic insights into microbiota-dependent metabolic alteration during circadian disruption.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0360">Taken together, the comparison of two models of genetic and environmentally induced circadian disruption revealed shared disruption at the level of GI clocks and identified microbial taxa and their functionalities involved in metabolic abnormalities of the host. Further, microbial alterations during SSW appear to be causal for the metabolic phenotype of the host. Our data provide first evidence that molecular alterations of GI clock function during circadian disruption are transferrable between organisms through the microbiome. Thereby our data highlight the intestinal clock-bacteria dialogue as a potent underlying factor in the development of metabolic diseases in humans exposed to circadian disruption due to their lifestyle.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contribution</title><p id="p0365">SK conceived and coordinated the project.

While the theoretical diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences is vast, the antigen-specific TCR repertoire is restricted by its peptide epitope and the presenting major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). It remains unclear how many TCR sequences are recruited into an antigen-specific T cell response, both within and across different organisms, and which factors shape both of these distributions. Infection of mice with ovalbumin-expressing cytomegalovirus (IE2-OVA-mCMV) represents a well-studied model system to investigate T cell responses given their size and longevity. Here we investigated &gt; 180,000 H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL-recognizing TCR CDR3α or CDR3β sequences from 25 individual mice spanning seven different time points during acute infection and memory inflation. In-depth repertoire analysis revealed that from a pool of highly diverse, but overall limited sequences, T cell responses were dominated by public clonotypes, partly with unexpectedly extreme degrees of sharedness between individual mice (“supra-public clonotypes”). Public clonotypes were found exclusively in a fraction of TCRs with a high generation probability. Generation probability and degree of sharedness select for highly functional TCRs, possibly mediated through elevating intraindividual precursor frequencies of clonotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>memory inflation</kwd><kwd>public clonotypes</kwd><kwd>generation probability</kwd><kwd>T cell response</kwd><kwd>TCR</kwd><kwd>convergent recombination</kwd><kwd>TCR repertoire</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pathogens-09-00650"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>T cells play a crucial role in the control of chronic and latent infections. Latent infection with CMV affects 60–100% of the general population [<xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]—largely depending on the socioeconomic status—but does not cause any symptoms unless the immune system is compromised. In immunosuppressed patients, for example hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients, CMV is indeed a major cause of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The significance of T cell mediated protection from overt CMV infection is further strongly supported by adoptive transfer experiments in mice [<xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and through the success of adoptive T cell therapy in human patients [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In immunocompetent individuals, viral latency and immune control seem to be in equilibrium. On the T cell side, this equilibrium is maintained by antigen-specific populations that can become extremely large (“inflationary T cells”) [<xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Inflationary T cells often harbor a senescent phenotype [<xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and an overall skewed CD4/CD8 ratio. Such a CMV-induced so-called immune risk phenotype [<xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] has been associated with increased mortality in the elderly [<xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Overall, the protective importance, size and longevity of CMV-specific T cells raise an intriguing question—at what cost does the immune system dedicate so much of its capacity to target individual CMV antigens [<xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]? Furthermore, however, these aspects have also made CMV T cell immunity an attractive model system to investigate acute and chronic T cell responses in general.</p><p>Since CMV-specific T cell responses have been studied so deeply, a surprising finding became apparent early on: CMV-specific T cell populations often contain public clonotypes, i.e., T cell clones that occur in more than a single individual [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is astonishing as it is a canonical feature of the adaptive immune system to be programmed by non-self antigens only and the TCR recombination process has been long believed to be random. In order to mediate robust protection against a plethora of different and unknown foreign antigens, a highly diverse TCR repertoire is needed [<xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. V(D)J recombination, deletions and additions of individual nucleotides in the CDR3 region of the TCR variable chains, as well as differential pairing of α and β chains, yield a theoretical diversity of up to 10<sup>20</sup> or in some estimates even 10<sup>61</sup> different solutions for TCRs [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The actual diversity in a single mouse [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or human being [<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] is considerably lower, but still believed to be in the range of about 10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> unique TCRs. It remains largely unanswered how many TCRs fit to a given antigen in principle (across different individuals) and how many TCRs contribute to an antigen-specific T cell response in a single individual.</p><p>If the number of structural solutions of a TCR to a given epitope is finite, it is intuitive that clonotypes would re-occur, rendering them public. Even more importantly, the theoretical TCR repertoire is in reality highly skewed, since generation probabilities for individual TCRs are highly heterogenous (“TCR generation bias”) [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, it has been experimentally shown that the degree of sharedness of public clonotypes is associated with its generation probability. This phenomenon of high generation probabilities leading to public clonotypes has been termed “convergent recombination” [<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>While there are indications that public clonotypes are found disproportionately often in CMV antigen-specific T cell responses, few studies have investigated the degree of “degree of sharedness”, i.e., in how many different individuals do public clonotypes re-occur [<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further, it is unclear how dominant such public clonotypes are within CMV-specific immune responses. A recent study showed that public clonotypes are dominant in inflationary CMV-specific T cell populations, but this work only investigated very late time points of infection, did not take into account different degrees of sharedness and calculated generation probability merely by distance from germline [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In recent years, computation of generation probabilities became significantly more refined and can now also take into account biochemical features of CDR3 sequences, such as hydrophobicity of amino acids at certain positions or common motifs [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We have previously performed in-depth repertoire sequencing of CMV antigen-specific T cell populations from 25 mice spanning seven different time points during acute infection with murine CMV and memory inflation [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We now further investigated the obtained 42,154 CDR3α and 139,374 CDR3β sequences with respect to their public occurrence (including quantitative analysis of the degree of sharedness between individual mice) and their generation probability. This analysis revealed that while there is an astonishingly high overall number of unique CDR3 sequences within the antigen-specific pool, dominant clonotypes are highly enriched for public clones, most notably clones with very high degrees of sharedness (“supra-public clonotypes”) and high generation probabilities. While it remains an intriguing speculation that the TCR recombination machinery may “foresee” which specificities would be highly useful in the fight against pathogens [<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we hypothesize that robust recruitment may simply be a result of higher precursor numbers in the antigen-unexperienced repertoire.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2. Results</title><p>We infected C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a tissue culture-derived Smith mCMV strain expressing OVA under the IE2 promotor (IE2-OVA-mCMV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), which led to inflationary T cell responses against OVA [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. All mice were infected at the age of seven weeks. Half of the mice had been previously thymectomized at the age of four weeks in order to investigate how the TCR repertoire evolved from a narrower precursor repertoire and deduct the influence of recent thymic emigrants on the inflationary T cell population. The success of thymectomy was controlled by qPCR for TCR excision circles [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. All mice were distributed across two independent experimental cohorts (two non-thymectomized cohorts, two thymectomized cohorts). We sorted the H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL-specific CD8+ T cell population from peripheral blood by flow cytometry at day 7, 15, 30, 58, 86, 120 and 170 post infection with sort purities of at least 99.5% [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Following RNA extraction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR, CDR3α and CDR3β bulk sequencing was performed. Sequences were considered only if an intact unique molecular identifier (UMI) was present and found more than once in a given sample. Clonotypes were defined as chains with identical CDR3 amino acid sequences. For further details see Materials and Methods and references [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.1. TCR Repertoire Evolution Stabilizes during Memory Inflation</title><p>Diversity can be assessed with a focus on the evenness of the distribution or the richness of unique samples. In relation to TCR repertoires, a repertoire can be diverse when TCR clones are evenly distributed despite a low number of unique samples or it can be diverse in terms of richness with a high number of unique samples even though samples are distributed in a very skewed manner. We first evaluated the evenness of TCR repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The evenness in both non-thymectomized and thymectomized animals decreased over time. The greatest loss in diversity was observed during the first 60 days, whereas thereafter the evenness stayed fairly stable. This is consistent with the outgrowth of stable dominating clonotypes during memory inflation [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The evenness in thymectomized animals was generally lower than in non-thymectomized animals. This difference was already apparent at day 7 post infection. Since thymectomy took place three weeks before infection, this could indicate that a narrower precursor repertoire in thymectomized animals is driven into more accentuated clonal selection early on. To investigate this more closely, we analyzed the cumulative number of unique CDR3β sequences over time for each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). The number of unique clones was only slightly elevated in non-thymectomized compared to thymectomized mice in the early phase of the immune response, but a richer repertoire was maintained throughout the chronic phase of infection. The decreased evenness in thymectomized animals can therefore not be simply explained by a narrower precursor repertoire in terms of unique clones. The decreased richness in thymectomized animals over time speaks for less efficient recruitment of new antigen-specific T cells. This could argue for recruitment of naïve T cells into the inflationary T cell response in non-thymectomized animals, but would also be in line with a defect of nourishment from a pool of memory T cells only becoming apparent at later time points of the immune response [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The repertoire evolution with regards to evenness, richness and qualitative clonal succession [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] can be seen in two representative mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>d).</p><p>The plateau of unique CDR3 sequences at late time points indicates a limited absolute number of antigen-specific unique clonotypes within a given mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). In an individual non-thymectomized mouse, we found around 200 unique CDR3α (data not shown) and around 400 CDR3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) sequences on average. These numbers were reduced in thymectomized mice. It is likely that these numbers represent an underestimate of the absolute number of antigen-specific clonotypes within a mouse. Two important reasons for this are the fact that a given CDR3β sequence can differentially pair with CDR3α sequences and that repertoire analysis was conducted from a small fraction (around 100 µl) of peripheral blood. The confounding effect of the sampling bias should be, however, alleviated through repetitive sampling over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). Importantly, the plateau of unique CDR3 sequences at late time points also confirmed that our repertoire analysis was highly constricted to the antigen-specific pool as, e.g., sort impurities would have led to sequencing of random clonotypes and thereby continuously increased the number of overall unique CDR3 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>c).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.2. Public Clonotypes Lead to Repertoire Saturation across Individual Mice</title><p>Of all unique clonotypes, about a third of CDR3α and a quarter of CDR3β sequences were “public”, which means that they occurred in more than one mouse at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). In addition to the mere information whether a clonotype was public or not, our standardized repertoire analysis in at least 12 mice per treatment allowed us to investigate the degree of sharedness. While 1939 unique CDR3α and 4225 unique CDR3β sequences were private, we also found CDR3α and CDR3β sequences across the entire spectrum of sharedness, including 10 CDR3α sequences found in 10/12 non-thymectomized mice and 36 unique CDR3β sequences found in 12/12 non-thymectomized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>b).</p><p>These data indicate that the overall TCR repertoire against SIINFEKL is diverse but limited. The presence of extreme “supra-public” clonotypes prompted us to investigate whether we could observe saturation effects when adding individual mouse repertoires cumulatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>c–f). If there were no public clones, with each added mouse repertoire the number of cumulative unique CDR3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d) or CDR3α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f) sequences would rise infinitely without saturation (gray data points and lines indicate an according simulation, treating public clones from the experimental data as private). Since in the experimental data we do see a substantial degree of sharedness, the cumulative numbers of unique CDR3 sequences start to fall below the “private only simulation diagonal” already within the 12 investigated TCR repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,e). We wondered whether we could make an extrapolation from these data to obtain a ballpark figure at which cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences there would be a plateau, provided an infinite number of mice were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>d,f). To this end, we fitted the data to a simple saturation equation, Y = Bmax*X/(Kd + X), in which Y is the cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences and X is the number of cumulative mouse repertoires. Bmax then indicates the saturated number of unique CDR3 sequences if an infinite number of mice was studied and Kd indicates the number of mice that is needed to observe 50% of Bmax. With this approach, we would observe saturation at a little less than 60,000 CDR3β sequences and a little less than 6000 CDR3α sequences. While 100 mice (=Kd) would need to be studied to see half of the overall maximum of CDR3β sequences, 41 mice would need to be studied in case of CDR3α. It is important to stress that the exact numbers should not be overinterpreted as our approach is prone to several confounding factors. While we did use UMI in our sequencing approach (reducing the likelihood for sequencing error bias), sequencing from peripheral blood is inherently subject to sampling bias. Furthermore, we did not perform αβ pairing analysis and our PCR was based on a RACE PCR protocol, making abundance estimates from bulk sequencing data unprecise, which would however be important for precise extrapolation of “unseen species”. These considerations are well-described challenges [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Throughout our analyses, we only analyzed clonotypes with a UMI &gt; 1. When we set additional filters with threshold clone fractions (i.e., when we only analyzed clones that showed a minimum clone fraction), Bmax decreased with increasingly strict filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>g). Remarkably, Kd remained rather stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f002">Figure 2</xref>h).</p><p>Overall, the data do allow us to draw two general conclusions: first, the number of unique clonotypes for H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL is highly diverse, but limited to an extent that makes reliable estimation of absolute numbers feasible for future investigation.

(Supra-) Public Clonotypes Are Preferentially Expanded during the Immune Response</title><p>Next, we investigated whether public clones are also preferentially recruited into the immune response. While evidence for this has been collected before, previous analyses were mostly confined to individual time points and investigated only private vs. public clones in general [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], thereby not incorporating the resolution of differential degrees of sharedness over the entire course of an immune response. Since the CDR3β repertoire is more diverse than the CDR3α repertoire and at the same time less prone to bias through second chains from non-excluded alleles, we focused our analyses from hereon on CDR3β sequences. We first looked at all clonotypes from all time points and mice pooled to obtain a broad overview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The median clone fraction (i.e., the fraction to which a clone contributes to the antigen-specific T cell response in a given mouse and at a given time point) of public clonotypes (degree of sharedness &gt; 1) was generally about one order of magnitude higher than the median clone fraction of private clonotypes (degree of sharedness = 1). While the median clone fraction did not differ further among different degrees of sharedness, individual clones with a clone fraction &gt; 0.2 mostly had a degree of sharedness of at least 5/12. Particularly supra-public clones with a degree of sharedness of 12/12 massively contributed to the overall immune response. Next, we concatenated the clonotypes with a given degree of sharedness for each mouse, and investigated the fraction of all unique CDR3β sequences and the sum of all clone fractions that would be represented by clones with a given degree of sharedness at day 15 and at day 120 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). While private clones constituted about 70% of all unique CDR3β sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, top left panel), they only contributed about 15% to the overall clone fraction at day 15 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, top right panel). Supra-public clonotypes with a degree of sharedness of 12/12 in turn contributed about 15% to the overall clone fraction, but only constituted 2% of unique CDR3β sequences to begin with. These data indicate preferential expansion of public clonotypes (in particular supra-public clonotypes with extreme degrees of sharedness).</p><p>Compared to day 15 post infection, at day 120 private clonotypes constituted less unique CDR3β sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, bottom panels). This indicates that during memory inflation, public clones are not only more likely to expand, but also more likely to be detectable at all. Next, we plotted the mean degree of sharedness of individual mouse repertoires over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Due to preferential expansion of (supra-)public clonotypes, the mean degree of sharedness was at around 5/12 already at day 7 post infection. The mean degree of sharedness rose to a little more than 6/12 from day 15 post infection onwards. In individual mice, the mean degree of sharedness fell again at late time points of infection due to the fact that, by chance, stable dominators were selected during memory inflation which showed partly low degrees of sharedness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f001">Figure 1</xref>d and [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for illustration of stable dominators after day 58 post infection). Across all mice the median of the mean degree of sharedness was rather stable at a remarkably high value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f003">Figure 3</xref>c).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.4. TCR Generation Probability Is Linked with Degree of Sharedness and Thereby Clonal Expansion</title><p>Differential generation probabilities of TCR sequences could be an explanation for differential degrees of sharedness. We therefore calculated generation probabilities for each amino acid clonotype using the OLGA algorithm (taking into account, among others, preferential VDJ pairing, the number of required insertions and deletions and motifs) [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Clonotypes with extremely low generation probabilities (&lt;10<sup>−25</sup>) were found exclusively for private clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Since there are also more private than public clonotypes, we calculated the median generation probability. Irrespective of whether clonotypes were included for which no generation probability could be calculated (presumably, but not necessarily, because it was too low; gen prob = “0”), the median generation probability rose from private to public clonotypes by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b). Nearly all of the clonotypes for which no generation probability could be calculated were private, which explains why the median shifted the most for private clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>b).</p><p>During the course of the immune response, clones with extremely low generation probabilities were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). Also, clones with a minimum degree of clone fraction showed a threshold generation probability. Clones with a clone fraction of &gt; 0.1 at any time point had a minimum generation probability of 10<sup>−17</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). Since mostly clones with a high generation probability expanded, the mean generation probability was as high as 10<sup>−6</sup>, which did not change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>e). This was further confirmed by focusing on the dominating clones at the peak of the acute immune response (day 15 post infection) and during memory inflation (day 120 post infection). The dominating clones (i.e., clones with a clone fraction &gt; 0.1) had exclusively very high generation probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>f). These high generation probabilities led in most cases to very high degrees of sharedness (median of 7 for day 15 and day 120 post infection). In turn, clones with a high degree of sharedness and/or generation probability represented higher median clone fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>g). We therefore finally explored whether generation probability and degree of sharedness could serve as predictors of TCRs that clonally expand within an antigen-specific immune response. In fact, both generation probability and degree of sharedness independently selected for clones with a higher clone fraction, with the combination of both parameters being the filter with the highest enrichment of expanding clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f004">Figure 4</xref>h). Among supra-public clonotypes with a generation probability of 10<sup>−7</sup> there was a 18.8% hit rate of clones with a clone fraction &gt; 0.1. This hit rate is 0.2% without any filter, indicating a 94-fold enrichment of clones that will at some point contribute more than 10% (clone fraction of &gt; 0.1) to an overall antigen-specific T cell response.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-pathogens-09-00650"><title>2.5. The Nucleotide-to-Amino Acid Ratio of Intraindividual TCR Sequences Is Associated with Interindividual Degrees of Sharedness via Generation Probability</title><p>It was previously speculated that the TCR generation machinery could have evolved in a manner that TCRs with high functionality against foreign epitopes are preferentially generated [<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This hypothesis is intriguing, but hard to confirm experimentally. An alternative explanation why TCRs with high generation probability are not only shared among many different individuals, but also robustly expand, is that high generation probabilities lead to repeated generation of the same clonotype within a given individual, thereby increasing the precursor frequencies of antigen-specific T cells in the naïve repertoire. We have previously shown how tightly increased precursor frequencies are linked to the robustness of antigen-specific T cell expansion [<xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For CDR3 nucleotide sequence copies it is not possible to deduct whether these sequences are derived from true clones (progeny of the same single cell) or if, by chance, the same nucleotide sequence has been generated twice. Functionally, however, TCRs are only determined through their amino acid sequence and due to the degeneracy of the base triplet code, the same CDR3 amino acid sequence can be generated through different nucleotide sequence variants (in fact, such convergence of different nucleotide sequences into one CDR3 amino acid sequence is an important parameter of the computation of CDR3 sequence generation probabilities [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p><p>We calculated for each clonotype how many nucleotide sequence variants lead to the same amino acid sequence (nt:aa ratio) within an individual mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This nt:aa ratio could be indicative of the precursor frequency for an amino acid clonotype within a given mouse. Generation probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>a) and degree of sharedness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) were both strongly associated with the nt:aa ratio (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00650-f005">Figure 5</xref>c for integrated data analysis). A single clonotype (CASSRTGEQYF) appeared in the form of four different nucleotide sequence variants (nt:aa ratio = 4) in two mice. This clone had one of the highest generation probabilities (1.04<sup>−5</sup>) and a maximum degree of sharedness (12/12). Clonotypes with a nt:aa ratio of 3, 2 or 1 had median generation probabilities and degrees of sharedness in descending respective orders. We finally investigated whether we could also directly observe that heightened nt:aa ratios would result in higher clone fractions. Indeed, median clone fractions rose with increasing nt:aa ratios from 1 to 3. For the two instances in which the clonotype CASSRTGEQYF was observed in the form of four different nucleotide sequence variants, it did not reach a high clone fraction. Overall, these data suggest that increased precursor frequencies, as potentially indicated by heightened nt:aa ratios, are not only a function of increased generation probabilities, but also result in higher degrees of sharedness. On average (as expressed by the median), higher nt:aa ratios result in higher clone fractions, but more and more precise data are needed to conclusively address this.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-pathogens-09-00650"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>We sequenced the TCR repertoire of IE2-OVA-mCMV-specific T cell responses in-depth over time. While we have previously focused our analysis on the successive outgrowth of dominating clones [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], in this work we first investigated how many new unique clones are recruited during the course of the immune response. This revealed that the TCR repertoire stabilizes during memory inflation not only in terms of its evenness, but also in terms of its composition of unique clonotypes. In non-thymectomized animals, stabilization occurred at a little less than 400 unique CDR3β sequences per mouse. This number is likely an underestimate of the absolute number of different clonotypes, since we cannot deduct with how many different CDR3α chains these CDR3β chains are pairing and the analysis from peripheral blood will be subject to sampling bias. These challenges to estimate the absolute number of unique TCRs, many of which are analogous to the “unseen species problem” in ecology, are extensively discussed elsewhere [<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Of note, however, the CD8+ T cell precursor frequency for SIINFEKL has previously been reported to be 50–200 cells [<xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and our own observations suggest this number to be even slightly higher (unpublished data). These numbers should approximate the number of overall observed sequences in the memory repertoire—if recruitment into the immune response is as complete as it has been reported for OT-I cells [<xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]—and therefore render some credence to our obtained numbers of unique TCRs per mouse.</p><p>Independent from these considerations, the observed repertoire stabilization during memory inflation is striking. First, this confirmed that our sequencing methodology was technically clean, as e.g., sorting impurities would have led to capturing random sequences and therefore to a continuous increase in cumulative unique CDR3 sequences. Second, while we most probably missed TCR sequences due to sampling bias at early time points, at least at late time points the sampling bias did not seem to be a confounding factor. Third, from a biological perspective nourishment of the antigen-specific pool during memory inflation did not seem to come from novel thymic emigrants. This is in line with previous reports that inflationary T cells are mainly fed by early-primed memory T cells [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In thymectomized animals the cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences was reduced. The fact that this reduction became apparent only at later time points could be explained by a more dominant sampling bias at early time points, although a role of thymic emigrants contributing to the late immune response cannot be excluded [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Fourth, the saturation of repertoires within individual mice gave us a leverage point to look at saturation across individual mice.</p><p>Such a saturation across individual mice is only possible when clonotypes are public. We confirmed previous reports that many CMV-specific clonotypes occur in more than one individual organism [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, we observed that the number of cumulative unique CDR3 sequences did not rise in a linear manner with increasing cumulative mouse repertoires analyzed, suggesting saturation to occur at some point. We applied a saturation model to our data to more closely investigate this. We observed that the maximum antigen-specific repertoire should be highly diverse, but limited, and predict that half of the maximum of overall TCR sequences should be visible at around 100 cumulative mouse repertoires, with the exact numbers being confounded by the same biases as discussed above. Future studies may therefore be able to more accurately predict the absolute number of unique clonotypes in a mouse by investigating around 100 mice (due to the present biases, this number may vary, but it is unlikely that it will be an underestimate by several orders of magnitude) while overcoming confounding factors by single-cell sequencing and harvesting material from blood and all lymphoid organs.</p><p>We observed that public clonotypes constituted the majority of expanded clones despite accounting only for a minority of unique CDR3 sequences, which is in line with previous reports investigating this aspect for IE3- and M38-specific T cell responses at late time points of infection [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Beyond mere classification into private vs. public, the degree of sharedness can be highly heterogenous. Few studies have so far investigated the degree of sharedness in a systematic manner [<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] despite its importance for contextualization of public sequences in respect to their generation probabilities [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We observed a considerable number of clonotypes in up to 10/12 mice for CDR3α and 12/12 mice for CDR3β. These “supra-public” clonotypes often dominated the antigen-specific response, which is completely disproportionate given their rarity (meaning how few of all unique CDR3 sequences they represent). Overall, the mean degree of sharedness of the antigen-specific repertoire was in-between 5–7 out of 12 mice, with no major shifts over time. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform a systematic and in-depth investigation these aspects for CMV, but also any kind of antigen-specific immune response.</p><p>The occurrence of public TCR sequences is tightly associated with TCR generation probability [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We applied OLGA [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for accurate estimation of generation probability to our unique data set of TCRs covering a wide range of degrees of sharedness and defined time points after infection. Generation probability markedly influenced the likelihood for a TCR to be public (with a threshold of at least 10<sup>−17</sup>), but did not further predict the degree of sharedness. The latter stands in contrast to previous reported work, which however only investigated TCR sequences in bulk (and did not focus on certain antigen-specificities) and thereby also analyzed a much larger number of sequences [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesize that, apart from sampling bias, TCR affinity could be a relevant confounding factor in this regard [<xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Overall, dominating clones at the acute phase of the immune response and during memory inflation showed high degrees of sharedness as well as high generation probabilities and we could show that the combination of both parameters can serve as an enrichment filter for identifying clones that will contribute significantly to the antigen-specific T cell response (arguably representing highly functional TCRs). This may prove useful for in silico prediction of TCRs with clinical potential in the context of adoptive cell therapy.</p><p>It has been argued that the TCR recombination machinery may have evolved in a manner that highly functional TCRs are inherently more probable to be generated [<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As intriguing as this thought is, such evolutionary aspects are hard to investigate experimentally. Instead, we hypothesize that heightened intraindividual precursor frequencies may explain why TCRs with high generation probability expand more robustly. To this end, we used the intraindividual number of nucleotide sequence variants that give rise to one common TCR amino acid sequence (nt:aa ratio) as a proxy indicator of precursor frequencies within a given mouse. Both generation probability and degree of sharedness were tightly associated with the nt:aa ratio. Since theoretical nt:aa ratio possibilities for a given sequences are an inherent part of generation probability calculation, this is not surprising, but validates the calculation and confirms the tight association with the degree of sharedness. On average (as expressed by the median), an elevated nt:aa ratio also indicated a higher clone fraction, although more data are needed to corroborate this point. A high clone fraction in clones with a nt:aa ratio of 1 does not exclude the possibility of an increased precursor frequency since, naturally, high generation probabilities can also lead to the exact same nucleotide sequence being generated within one organism repetitively. We have previously shown how much the robustness of a clonal response depends on the number of precursors [<xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The exact copy number abundance of individual clonotypes that is present in a naïve antigen-specific repertoire therefore represents a highly relevant point for future investigation.</p><p>Overall, here we show that generation probability is a major determinant of the T cell response to SIINFEKL-expressing CMV. The results are consistent with so far described T cell responses against other natural CMV epitopes [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], arguing against a special intrinsic feature of SIINFEKL to induce (supra-)public T cell responses. Instead, the fact that similarly public responses are observed towards natural CMV epitopes points into the direction that the public nature of the T cell response could be due to the mode of antigen presentation rather than the epitope itself. This is in line with reports describing that it is rather the context of gene expression that defines the immunodominance hierarchy of CMV antigens [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In future studies, it will be important to investigate both T cell responses against the same epitope under different expression modes as well as against different epitopes (ideally expressed in the same mode) to shed further light on these issues. Since many different model systems exist for SIINFEKL, our work provides a resource to compare the T cell responses to the same epitope under different expression systems (e.g., by using <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> OVA or OVA-expressing tumor model systems). Such comparisons will be particularly informative since CMV vectors are being investigated for vaccine delivery, and CMV epitope presentation seems to induce unconventional immunogenicity patterns [<xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our choice to study the T cell response against a model antigen in a highly controlled experimental system was therefore deliberate. It should be noted, however, that translation of our findings to the human setting will also be complicated by the fact that human beings are highly diverse in their HLA status (which has a major effect on the immunodominance of individual epitopes) and can be re-infected by different CMV strains.</p><p>While we have previously reported TCR affinity to be a significant modulator of T cell fate during CMV infection [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we did not observe such dramatic changes with regards to the mean generation probability over time (during the course of the immune response, e.g., when comparing the peak of the acute response to time points during memory inflation). Rather, it appears that generation probability affects the likelihood to significantly expand within the T cell response at any time point during infection. We therefore hypothesize that most of the presented results are transferrable to other infection and perhaps even non-infectious disease settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.

In brief, mice were thymectomized or non-thymectomized at the age of four weeks. Completeness of thymectomy was controlled by macroscopic inspection, and an effect on thymic output was controlled for by qPCR for TREC. The operating procedure did not result in any confounding effects as controlled for through mock operated cohorts in pilot experiments (unpublished data). C57BL/6 mice were infected with an mCMV strain expressing OVA under the IE2 promotor [<xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] at the age of seven weeks. All mice were distributed across two independent experimental cohorts (two non-thymectomized cohorts, two thymectomized cohorts). We sorted the H2k<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL-specific CD8+ T cell population by flow cytometry at day 7, 15, 30, 58, 86, 120 and 170 post infection with sort purities most often reaching 100% [<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For CDR3 sequencing, RNA of sorted antigen-specific T cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a biotinylated oligo dT primer. An adaptor sequence was added to the 3’ end of all cDNA, which contains the Illumina P7 universal priming site and a 17-nucleotide UMI. Products were purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads followed by a primary PCR reaction using a pool of primers targeting the TCRα and TCRβ regions, as well as a sample-indexed Illumina P7C7 primer. The TCR-specific primers contained tails corresponding to the Illumina P5 sequence. PCR products were then purified using AMPure XP beads. A secondary PCR was performed to add the Illumina C5 clustering sequence to the end of the molecule containing the constant region. The number of secondary PCR cycles was tailored to each sample to avoid entering plateau phase, as judged by a prior quantitative PCR analysis. Final products were purified, quantified with Agilent Tapestation and pooled in equimolar proportions, followed by high-throughput paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. For sequencing, the Illumina 600 cycle kit was used with the modifications that 325 cycles was used for read 1, 6 cycles for the index reads, 300 cycles for read 2 and a 20% PhiX spike-in to increase sequence diversity.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.2. Clone Identification</title><p>Extraction and quantification of T-cell receptor sequences was performed using IGX-Profile software (ENPICOM B.V., ‘s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands). Sequences were considered only if (1) an intact UMI barcode was present and (2) the UMI was found more than once in a given sample. Clonotypes were defined as chains with identical CDR3 amino acid sequences. Receptor counts were summed for sequences with differing CDR3 nucleotide sequences, provided they shared CDR3 amino acid identity. Samples with exceptionally low read counts (&lt;45,000 reads) were excluded from analysis. Receptors were further filtered if one of the following criteria was met: (1) Average PHRED quality score was below 20; (2) CDR3 sequence contained a stop codon; (3) CDR3 was shorter than 6 amino acids long.</p><p>All data grouping, merging and processing was performed with Python 3, using the Pandas library.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.3. Generation Probability</title><p>Calculation of the generation probability was based on the CDR3 amino acid sequence. For this, OLGA [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00650" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was used. The generation probability was calculated for TRB (CDR3β) sequences. The generation probability was not calculated for TRA (CDR3α) due to the lack of availability of model parameters. Sequences with a generation probability of 0 were excluded from analysis unless otherwise indicated.</p><p>For the saturation analysis, the clones belonging to the same mouse were pooled. Next, a random ordering of mice (e.g., [mouse_{1}, mouse_{5}, … mouse_{2}]), was iterated. At each step of the iteration, the set of clones found in a mouse was merged with the set of all previously observed clones. The result was a set of data points mapping the number of mice (=iteration number) to the number of unique clones observed. 100 such random orderings were made, and the resulting data points were then fitted using a saturation model. For this, the following equation was used:<disp-formula>Y = Bmax × X/(Kd + X)</disp-formula>
in which Y is the cumulative number of unique CDR3 sequences and X is the number of cumulative mouse repertoires. Bmax then indicates the saturated number of unique CDR3 sequences if an infinite number of mice was studied, and Kd indicates the number of mice that is needed to observe 50% of Bmax. Fitting was performed with Prism GraphPad (Version 8.1.2).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-pathogens-09-00650"><title>4.4.

While a plethora of tools have been developed for the analysis of 16S rRNA gene data, only a few platforms offer a user-friendly interface and none comprehensively covers the whole analysis pipeline from raw data processing down to complex analysis. We introduce Namco, an R shiny application that offers a streamlined interface and serves as a one-stop solution for microbiome analysis. We demonstrate Namco’s capabilities by studying the association between a rich fibre diet and the gut microbiota composition. Namco helped to prove the hypothesis that butyrate-producing bacteria are prompted by fibre-enriched intervention. Namco provides a broad range of features from raw data processing and basic statistics down to machine learning and network analysis, thus covering complex data analysis tasks that are not comprehensively covered elsewhere.

</p></list-item></list><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Impact Statement</title></caption><p>Amplicon sequencing is a key technology of microbiome research and has yielded many insights into the complexity and diversity of microbiota. To fully utilize these data, a wide range of tools have been developed for raw data processing, normalization, statistical analysis and visualization. These tools are mostly available as R packages but cannot be easily linked in an automated pipeline due to the heterogeneous characteristics of microbiome data. Instead, user-friendly tools for explorative analysis are needed to give biomedical researchers without experience in scripting languages the possibility to fully exploit their data. Several tools for microbiome data analysis have been proposed in recent years which cover a broad range of functionality, but only few offer a user-friendly and beginner-friendly interface while covering the entire value chain from raw data processing down to complex analysis. With Namco (<ext-link ns0:href="https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/namco/" ext-link-type="uri">https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/namco/</ext-link>), we present a beginner-friendly one-stop solution for microbiome analysis that covers upstream analyses such as raw data processing and taxonomic binning and downstream analyses such as basic statistics, machine learning and network analysis, among other features.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s3"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade, microbiome research has contributed to our understanding of human health and microbiome-associated diseases with implications for diagnosis, prevention and treatment [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several studies have discovered important links between the gut microbiome and human diseases including diabetes [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], cancer [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and brain disorders [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, microbiome datasets are generated using either targeted (amplicon) gene sequencing to characterize the microbial composition and phylogeny or shotgun metagenomics to study, in addition, the gene-coding and functional potential of the microbiome. Due to the comparably lower sequencing costs, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the most commonly available method. Analysis of 16S (or 18S in the case of eukaryotes) rRNA genes can be grouped into four steps. First, amplicons are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For OTUs, sequencing errors are addressed by choosing a similarity threshold of typically 97% for clustering whereas the latter employs a denoising strategy to identify the unique error-corrected sequence of an organism [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several benchmark studies have proved that denoising methods provide better resolution and accuracy than OTU clustering methods [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7, 9</xref>]. Along with taxonomic profiling, various measures of alpha and beta diversity are typically computed to study the microbial diversity within and between samples, respectively. Additional analysis steps include, for instance, (i) differential abundance analysis to identify bacteria and/or functions that differ between groups of interest, (ii) <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> inference of metagenomes for functional profiling and (iii) microbial association analysis through correlation, co-occurrence and network inference methods.</p><p>Many open-source tools have been developed for microbiome data analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Mothur</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/GaAR" ext-link-type="uri">10</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">QIIME2</italic> [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">DADA2</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/hxpA" ext-link-type="uri">8</ext-link>] and <italic toggle="yes">LotuS2</italic> [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] offer processing of raw sequencing files through clustering and annotation of 16S rRNA genes and provide OTU or ASV tables which serve as an input for further downstream analysis. The <italic toggle="yes">QIIME2</italic> [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] pipeline offers more than 20 plugins for downstream analysis including the q2-sample-classifier for supervised classification and regression analysis [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], q2-longitudinal for time-series analysis [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and plugins for compositional data analysis [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, a plethora of R packages have been implemented to perform statistical analysis and high-quality visualizations on amplicon tables, such as <italic toggle="yes">Phyloseq</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/Hink+vcNT" ext-link-type="uri">15, 16</ext-link>] and <italic toggle="yes">themetagenomics</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/rAif" ext-link-type="uri">17</ext-link>]. Even though R scripts utilizing these tools offer a powerful approach to analyse microbial data, their application can be demanding for users without scripting knowledge and bioinformatics training. Hence, there is a need for user-friendly tools that can support end-to-end exploration of microbiomes. To this end, several web-based tools have been developed including <italic toggle="yes">microbiomanalyst</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/rqqS" ext-link-type="uri">18</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">IMNGS</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/vp6U" ext-link-type="uri">19</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">iMAP</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/heEB" ext-link-type="uri">20</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">MGRAST</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/sj71" ext-link-type="uri">21</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">wiSDOM</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/3o0f" ext-link-type="uri">22</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">VAMPS</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/aZDU" ext-link-type="uri">23</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">Shiny-Phyloseq</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/vcNT" ext-link-type="uri">16</ext-link>], etc. However, most of these tools (i) cover only the downstream part of the analysis and often omit raw data processing, (ii) offer only standard analysis and are thus not sufficient for more complex data sets, (iii) omit functional profiling or use outdated approaches, such as <italic toggle="yes">Tax4FUN</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/gjLX" ext-link-type="uri">24</ext-link>] and PICRUSt1 [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/VVfr" ext-link-type="uri">25</ext-link>] which were outperformed by <italic toggle="yes">PICRUSt2</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/FykY" ext-link-type="uri">26</ext-link>], (iv) do not offer confounder analysis, (v) offer no support for time-series, (vi) lack support for machine learning, and (vii) do not construct microbial association networks and differential networks on different taxonomic ranks.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="F1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Comparisons of Namco with other web-based tools for microbiome data analysis.</p></caption><graphic ns0:href="mgen-8-852-g001" position="float" /></fig><p>To address these limitations, we introduce Namco, an R (v 4.1) shiny application that offers a streamlined and user-friendly interface and serves as a one-stop solution for microbiome analysis.

Namco’s thoroughly documented and easy-to-use graphical interface is intended to eliminate the use of command-line arguments during data processing, making advanced microbiome analysis accessible to a broad range of biomedical researchers. Privacy legislation such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can prevent users from uploading their data to web tools such as Namco.

Alternatively, users can start their analysis with a previously generated OTU or ASV table, which can either include relative abundance values or read counts. For simplicity, we refer to these as features throughout the paper. Features should be labelled either by their taxonomy or alternatively by a unique id which Namco can map to a separate tabular file with taxonomic labels that can be uploaded separately by the user. Optionally, users can upload a metadata file containing additional information for each sample which can be utilized for groupwise differences, correlation, confounder or condition-specific analysis, for instance. Finally, users can optionally provide a tree file in newick format for phylogenetic tree analysis, for diversity analysis or to create ecologically organized heatmaps.

Users can change the default parameters such as trimming length depending on the amplicon length and the quality score threshold.

This gives an overall picture of the input data and will help in preparing the input data for further processing. Normalization and filtering are considered crucial steps in microbial analyses [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30, 31</xref>]. By default, Namco applies 0.25% of the abundance filter on the DADA2-generated features and normalizes abundance to 10000 reads before downstream analysis. Filtering the abundance of both OTUs and ASVs at &gt;0.25 % [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was identified as an effective threshold to prevent the identification of spurious taxa to a large extent. Alternatively, users can also choose different normalization methods and filtering percentages such as sampling depth, rarefaction and centred log-ratio transformation (CLR) [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition to the normalization methods, Namco offers different filtering options based on sample prevalence and relative abundance, as microbiome data are very sparse in nature and often have zero counts in most samples. These rare taxa are caused by sequencing artefacts, contamination and/or sequencing errors [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, Namco utilizes the decontam R package [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] which can differentiate contaminants from non-contaminants across diverse studies [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35, 36</xref>] and hence improves the quality of biological conclusions in microbiome studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Basic analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Visualization of taxonomic binning and ecologically organized heatmap</title><p>Namco integrates R-scripts from <italic toggle="yes">Rhea</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/2z5k" ext-link-type="uri">37</ext-link>] and <italic toggle="yes">phyloseq</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/Hink" ext-link-type="uri">15</ext-link>] to perform taxonomic profiling and diversity analysis and provides different options to visualize the distribution of dominant taxa at different ranks (domain, phylum, class, order, family and genus) among groups using barplots. In addition, taxonomic distribution can also be inferred based on intra-individual differences by visualizing taxa for individual samples. Users can download feature tables of relative abundances aggregated at different taxonomic levels and export any of the generated plots. The advanced heatmap option in Namco creates a heatmap using ordination methods to organize the rows and columns instead of a hierarchical clustering approach which gives an overview of the abundance of features across sample groups that are very high/low in abundance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Diversity analysis</title><p>Alpha diversity quantifies the diversity of the microbiome within a group. Namco supports five common alpha diversity measures, namely <italic toggle="yes">Shannon entropy</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/TJzS" ext-link-type="uri">38</ext-link>] and <italic toggle="yes">Simpson index</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/dRm3" ext-link-type="uri">39</ext-link>] together with their counterparts accounting for the effective number of species [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] as well as richness. Users can select different categories from the metadata to visualize alpha diversity and determine significant differences via a Wilcoxon test. Beta diversity analysis explains the variation between groups and relies on a phylogenetic tree as input along with the feature table to calculate dissimilarity. Namco supports the most common distance metrics including <italic toggle="yes">weighted</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">unweighted unifrac distances</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">generalized unifrac</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/n41i" ext-link-type="uri">41</ext-link>], <italic toggle="yes">variance adjusted unifrac distance</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bray Curtis dissimilarity</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/kpl2" ext-link-type="uri">42</ext-link>]. Calculation of <italic toggle="yes">unifrac distances</italic> is only possible if a tree file has been uploaded. The results are presented using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, it is also possible to visualize the distance as a hierarchically clustered dendrogram which helps to identify closely related samples. Significance between groups is determined by a permutational multivariate analysis of variances using the adonis function of the vegan R-package [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values are corrected for multiple testing following Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Differential analysis</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Differential abundance testing using simple statistical tests and association analysis</title><p>A key aim of microbial research is to identify differences in microbial composition between conditions or phenotypes. Namco reports statistically significant features between the sample groups using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test (<italic toggle="yes">SIAMCAT</italic> R-package [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]), which was shown to reliably control the false discovery rate in differential abundance analysis [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Users can choose groups that should be compared against each other and adjust the significance level as well as other filtering parameters. Differential abundance can be calculated at different taxonomic levels such as phylum or genus, where Namco aggregates the feature table accordingly. Namco shows the distribution of microbial relative abundance along with the significance and a generalized fold change [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] as a non-parametric measure of effect size. In addition to the Wilcoxon test, Namco also offers the Kruskal–Wallis test to find significant differences between more than two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>Namco provides correlation analysis to reveal significant associations between taxa or between taxa and metadata such as continuous experimental variables. Namco further considers relative abundances of features at different levels (phylum, class, order, etc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Topic modelling</title><p>Topic modelling was originally designed to uncover hidden thematic structures in document collections [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This concept was adapted to metagenomic analyses to explore co-occurring taxa as topics and to find topics associated with the provided sample metadata [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Namco employs the <italic toggle="yes">themetagenomic</italic> R [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/03kj" ext-link-type="uri">50</ext-link>] package to predict topics and to study their association with sample metadata, which can be continuous, binary, categorical or factor covariates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Functional profiling</title><p>Microbial composition varies widely between individuals, making the robust identification of phenotype-associated microbial features challenging. One can hypothesize that the functional potential of the microbiome is more robustly associated with a phenotype than the microbial composition. While investigating the functional potential of the microbiome is not directly feasible with 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, several tools have been proposed for inferring the functional profile with the help of reference sequencing databases. To this end, Namco adapts the <italic toggle="yes">PICRUSt2</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/FykY" ext-link-type="uri">26</ext-link>] approach, which showed improved accuracy and flexibility compared to related tools including <italic toggle="yes">PICRUSt1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Tax4FUN2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Piphillin</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PanFP</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/FykY" ext-link-type="uri">26</ext-link>]. Namco also performs differential analysis on the predicted KEGG orthologes, enzyme classification numbers and pathways using <italic toggle="yes">Aldex2</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/8uoJ" ext-link-type="uri">51</ext-link>], which was recently reported to perform best for this type of analysis [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The relative abundances of significant KEGG annotation terms are plotted in a barplot along with the p-value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Phylogenetic tree analysis</title><p>Phylogenetic analysis is part of the basic steps to get an overview of the evolutionary relationships between features. Namco displays the provided/calculated phylogenetic tree in circular or rectangular format. In addition, users can add two heatmap layers as taxonomic ranks and/or a meta-group. The meta-group heatmaps are coloured based on the abundance of the features in the corresponding meta-group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Network analysis</title><p>Several methods for inferring and analysing microbial co-occurrence networks were developed to study the role of microbial interactions in association with the host [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53, 54</xref>]. Namco implements multiple strategies for network construction. As a simple approach, the feature abundance matrix is converted into a binary indicator matrix using an abundance cutoff (presence/absence) (the default cut-off is 1: all features with a value &lt;1 are considered absent, while the rest are considered present). This cutoff can be adapted manually to get a more strict binary representation of the abundance matrix. Next, the number of co-occurring feature pairs is counted across samples for each group (e.g. case and control-pairwise) and the difference in co-occurrence counts, as well as the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change between the groups, is calculated and displayed as a network where nodes represent features and edges represent frequent group-specific interactions. For more advanced approaches, Namco employs the <italic toggle="yes">NetComi</italic> [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] R package, where users can build microbial association networks at different taxonomy levels using nine different network construction algorithms. In addition, <italic toggle="yes">NetComi</italic> offers a method for differential network analysis between two conditions to identify pairs of taxa differentially associated between two groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Confounder analysis and explained variation</title><p>Confounding variables may mask the actual relationship between the dependent and independent variables in a study [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In particular, microbiome composition is associated with several host variables including body mass index (BMI), sex, age and geographical location, among others [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Namco utilizes the permutational multivariate analysis of variances (adonis function of the <italic toggle="yes">vegan</italic> R-package) [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to rule out confounding factors using available information from the user-provided metadata table. The explained variation of covariates is determined by <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> values which are considered significant at p≤0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Classification based on random forest</title><p>Beyond differential abundance analysis, an important question is if a classification model can be trained on a minimal set of features to robustly predict the outcome (e.g. disease state or treatment response). Such models highlight the potential of microbiome data for prognostic and diagnostic purposes through biomarkers and surrogate endpoints. Namco allows users to build classification models and identify important features using machine learning algorithms. Within Namco, random forest (<italic toggle="yes">ranger</italic> [<ext-link ns0:href="https://paperpile.com/c/0sCgf9/MXY7" ext-link-type="uri">58</ext-link>] R package) is used as a classification tool, since it has shown good performance even on comparably small sample sizes in microbial data analysis [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59, 60</xref>]. By default, Namco splits the data into training and test sets and performs 10-fold repeated cross-validation. Experienced users can modify advanced parameters such as the ratio of training and test sets, the number of cross-validation folds, the resampling method and the number of decision trees. The results are summarized in a confusion matrix and a receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) plot which helps in evaluating the model performance. The most informative features that were used for classification can be extracted as biomarker candidates for hypothesis generation and further research.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Time-series analysis and clustering</title><p>Time-series analysis in Namco allows users to determine how microbial communities including taxa, OTUs/ASVs and other features such as richness change over time. For instance, time-series analysis helps to study the microbial changes in response to a treatment over multiple timepoints or during different stages of host development. Namco offers different options to modify the inputs for time-series line charts, including displays of changes in either relative abundance or absolute abundance or richness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Use case</title><p>To illustrate the broad utility of Namco, we analysed human faecal samples from an interventional cross-over study.

Significant KO terms with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.05 were grouped according to KO categories in order to understand their functions.

We implemented Namco to serve as a one-stop data analysis platform that performs both raw data processing and basic as well as advanced downstream analyses of microbial datasets. Namco integrates previously available tools into a single coherent computational workflow and allows the user to construct, analyse and understand microbial composition in a fast and reproducible manner. This platform is intended to eliminate the use of command-line arguments during data processing. Namco is accessible in the web browser and hence does not require the installation of any software packages. Namco also allows results from each analysis to be saved as an R session which can be used to resume at any time, thus simplifying sharing of research results. Since Namco is available as a Docker image, it can be conveniently installed locally or on a clinical server behind a firewall to facilitate the GDPR-compliant analysis of sensitive data without the need for an upload to the public Namco instance. Detailed comparisons between other web-based tools (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) showed that Namco offers a unique set of functions, such as time series clustering, function profiling using PICRUSt2, confounder analysis and topic modelling.</p><p>We considered a dietary intervention study as a case study to explore the features of Namco. We examined the association of rich fibre dietary intake with the gut microbiota composition through basic and advanced analysis in Namco. We investigated differences in relative abundance between the IM and M groups, where we compared the top abundant taxa and also studied the intra-individual variation in gut microbiome with respect to fibre-enriched diets. After exploring the datasets in terms of relative abundance and diversity analysis, we found that genera with significant differences between the IM and M groups were involved in the production of butyrate, an SCFA that helps to maintain homeostasis of the gut via anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial actions [<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86–88</xref>]. Namco did not only provide information about differentially abundant microbial composition but also helped in determining the significantly different KO terms and pathways. Namco revealed that the IM group showed a positive association with the presence of glucokinase, which belongs to amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. High fibre intake had a positive impact on glucose metabolism in humans. Studies have shown that long-term intake of fibre improves glucose homeostasis [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Additionally, Namco also identified ABC transporters that play a major role in the transmission of glucose through plasma membranes as significantly correlated with the IM group [<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It was also possible to study microbial interactions by generating differential microbial co-occurrence networks at the genus level using Namco. The topological features of the resulting differential network from the IM and M groups showed only a slight difference in the estimated associations. Overall, Namco provides a much needed interface to analyse microbial community data in a more intuitive way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present Namco, a shiny R application dedicated to providing end-to-end microbiome analysis for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We incorporate leading R packages for both upstream and downstream analysis in an efficient framework for researchers to characterize and understand the microbial community structure in their data, leading to valuable insights into the connection between the microbial community and phenotypes of interest. We plan to further expand Namco with support for novel analysis techniques and for correlation of microbial abundances with other data sources such as metabolomics and transcriptomics.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Funding information</title><p>This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German 582 Research Foundation) – Projektnummer 395357507 – SFB 1371.

Here, improper immune regulation can cause inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis. Antibody therapies blocking signaling through the CD40–CD40L axis showed promising results as these molecules are deregulated in certain IBD patients. To better understand the mechanism, we used transgenic DC-LMP1/CD40 animals with a constitutive CD40-signal in CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, causing a lack of intestinal CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) and failure to induce regulatory T (iTreg) cells. These mice rapidly develop spontaneous fatal colitis, accompanied by dysbiosis and increased inflammatory IL-17<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Th17/Th1 and IFN-γ <sup>+</sup> Th1 cells. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of the microbiota on disease development and detected elevated IgA- and IgG-levels in sera from DC-LMP1/CD40 animals. Their serum antibodies specifically bound intestinal bacteria, and by proteome analysis, we identified a 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL (Hsp60) from <italic>Helicobacter hepaticus</italic> (<italic>Hh</italic>) as the main specific antigen targeted in the absence of iTregs. When re-derived to a different <italic>Hh</italic>-free specific-pathogen-free (SPF) microbiota, mice showed few signs of disease, normal microbiota, and no fatality. Upon recolonization of mice with <italic>Hh</italic>, the disease developed rapidly. Thus, the present work identifies GroEL/Hsp60 as a major <italic>Hh</italic>-antigen and its role in disease onset, progression, and outcome in this colitis model. Our results highlight the importance of CD103<sup>+</sup> DC- and iTreg-mediated immune tolerance to specific pathobionts to maintain healthy intestinal balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Colitis</kwd><kwd>CD40</kwd><kwd><italic>Helicobacter hepaticus</italic></kwd><kwd>GroEL</kwd><kwd>CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs</kwd><kwd>iTregs</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/501100001659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Gastrointestinal Microbiome Research (CEGIMIR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Center for Infection Research (DZIF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DFG Priority Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft SFB1054 B03 to T.B. and A06 to A.K.; B.S., L.J. and D.R. were supported by the Center for Gastrointestinal Microbiome Research (CEGIMIR) of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).

As mice with spontaneous colitis have the propensity to develop antibody responses against commensal bacteria,<sup><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> we next set out to identify antibody specificities in DC-LMP1/CD40 mice. We used cecal bacterial lysate (CBL) from C57BL/6 mice of the same colony, representing unaltered intestinal microbiota for ELISA.<sup><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In DC-LMP1/CD40 mice, serum IgG response to commensal antigens was significantly increased at the 10-week time point if compared to control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(c</xref>), left). In contrast, we detected significantly higher serum IgA reactivities starting at the age of 10 weeks at all time points analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(c</xref>), right). To further visualize bacterial antigens potentially recognized by serum Ig from DC-LMP1/CD40 mice, we tested these sera also by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(d</xref>)). Serum IgG from both DC-LMP1/CD40 mice and control littermates, detected some proteins of different sizes ranging from 10 to 250 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(d</xref>), left).

This reactivity increased with the age of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(d</xref>), left).

Thus, bacteria-specific antibodies are not detectable in sera from healthy SPF-housed mice.<sup><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that IgA-coating seems to occur preferentially with microbiota which have enhanced potential for inflammation (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>). Furthermore, previous reports showed that IgA increased the invasiveness of segmented filamentous bacteria<sup><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and <italic>Helicobacter</italic> species.<sup><xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> As microbiota were strongly coated with IgA in DC-LMP1/CD40 mice,<sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> elevated IgA could contribute to colitis, according to previous studies. However, during inflammatory conditions, systemic antibodies are produced as a consequence of mucosal barrier dysfunction and thus increased exposure of commensals at systemic sites.<sup><xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> The presence of commensal-specific serum antibodies in DC-LMP1/CD40 mice therefore suggests that compartmentalization might be broken in mice with colitis, leading to systemic antibody responses.</p><p>Only recently, it was reported that especially members of Proteobacteria are able to induce T cell-dependent serum IgA responses in conventionally housed mice to protect them from lethal sepsis.<sup><xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> In this study, commensal <italic>Helicobacter muridarum</italic> was identified as the driving species, which would induce mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells as well as IgA<sup>+</sup> bone marrow plasma cells.<sup><xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Our data suggest that dysbiosis in DC-LMP1/CD40 mice affects the dissemination of bacteria, inducing systemic IgG as well as IgA production. This hypothesis is also supported by human studies, reporting elevated serum antibody levels in IBD patients.<sup><xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> However, we also found certain levels of bacteria-specific serum IgG in control littermates. One explanation for this observation might be that we used conventionally but not SPF-housed mice for a part of our study. This seems more analogous to healthy humans, where also some level of systemic bacteria-specific IgG exists, which does increase further during IBD.<sup><xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup></p><p>We identified serum antibodies from transgenic DC-LMP1/CD40 animals being bacteria-specific and recognizing the 60 kDa GroEL, a protein that is also secreted by <italic>Helicobacter</italic>.<sup><xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> The fact that only the 60 kDa chaperonin from <italic>Hh</italic> was identified with this method was surprising, but heat shock proteins have been reported as immunodominant antigens, inducing humoral and cellular immune responses during several diseases in humans and mice.

In contrast, young DC-LMP1/CD40 mice showed already reduced prevalence, while <italic>Hh</italic> was hardly detectable in older DC-LMP1/CD40 mice. One reason for this phenomenon might be the clearance of <italic>Hh</italic>, eventually because of increased anti-<italic>Hh</italic> serum IgG and IgA levels. Alternatively, <italic>Hh</italic> may be simply displaced, for example, by <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, which bloom<sup><xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> during inflammation in DC-LMP1/CD40 animals.

Interestingly, also IL-10-deficient mice developed intestinal inflammation with delayed onset and less severity in 5- to 6-month-old animals when maintained under SPF conditions.<sup><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In addition, <italic>Hh</italic>-free transgenic mice with Treg-specific c-Maf deficiency developed mild spontaneous colitis at a later age of 6 to 12 months.<sup><xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> The protection from early disease onset in <italic>Hh</italic>-free DC-LMP1/CD40 mice suggests that <italic>Hh</italic> might be a very potent disease driver. Although we could not find any evidence for specific commensals involved in disease initiation in aged <italic>Hh</italic>-free SPF-housed transgenic mice, also other bacteria may cause the disease, although much weaker, with later onset and in fewer mice. When kept under SPF-conditions, the lack of iTregs and CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs in DC-LMP1/CD40 mice had no impact on the taxa composition of the intestinal microbiota of these mice. Therefore, we assume that the dramatic changes in taxa composition observed in the same mice under conventional housing were due to inflammation caused or initiated by <italic>Hh</italic>.</p><p>While we determined <italic>Hh</italic> as a disease driver in CD40-mediated colitis model, this microbe did not have a direct impact, neither on DC nor on Treg differentiation in the colon LP, as CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and iTregs were similarly reduced in both, <italic>Hh</italic>-free and <italic>Hh</italic>-positive DC-LMP1/CD40 animals.<sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In contrast, <italic>Hh</italic> affected CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cell differentiation in the colon, which significantly increased IL-17<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Th17/Th1 and IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells.

Here, we identified <italic>Hh</italic> as a disease driver in the DC-LMP1/CD40 colitis model. In the context of constitutive CD40-signaling in DCs, we could show that Hh causes an increase in IFN-γ expression in Th17 cells which correlates with tissue damage in the intestine. This may result from transdifferentiation of nonpathogenic Th17 cells into pathogenic Th1 cells. However, this hypothesis has to be confirmed by fate mapping experiments, using the IL-17A-Cre mice and an eYFP reporter in the Rosa26-locus. Yet, this is challenging as the transgene LMP1/CD40 is also integrated into the Rosa26-locus.</p><p>Our results are also of relevance for other studies using conventionally housed mice as <italic>Hh</italic> is endemic in many mouse colonies. Our data further confirm the important role of the gut microbial composition during health and disease and reveal that a single bacterial species dramatically affects host immunity, if compromised. The identification of other potentially disease driving bacteria and specific bacterial antigens and underlying mechanisms in IBD is important. This further contributes to understanding the complex interaction of microbiota and host immune cells for development and improvement of personalized therapeutic strategies in IBD.</p></sec><sec id="s0004" disp-level="1"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0004-s2001" disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>DC-LMP1/CD40 mice were generated as previously described.<sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Briefly, CD11cCre mice<sup><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> were crossed with LMP1/CD40<sup>fl/flSTOP<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> animals to obtain DC-LMP1/CD40 mice with constitutive CD11c-specific CD40-signaling.</p><p>Mice were analyzed in sex- and age-matched groups of 8–25 weeks of age, unless otherwise stated.
